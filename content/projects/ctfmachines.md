In this section, you will find the **CTF machines** I have personally created. Currently, there is only one machine available called **SilentDev**, with plans to add more at different difficulty levels.

Each machine offers challenges designed to practice exploitation and analysis techniques, from basic to more advanced skills.

## Medium Difficulty Machines ðŸŸ 

### SilentDev

**SilentDev** requires some basic exploitation and analysis skills, as well as more advanced techniques in certain parts. It's an excellent challenge **for intermediate players** wanting to broaden their CTF experience.
