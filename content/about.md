I am currently studying **Systems and Network Administration**, with a strong focus on **offensive security** and **penetration testing**.
I enjoy discovering vulnerabilities, exploiting them in controlled environments, and learning from the process to strengthen overall security.

I improve my skills by solving **CTF challenges** on platforms like [**Hack The Box**](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/1296157) and [**HackMyVM**](https://hackmyvm.eu/profile/?user=Conper).
