To start, we perform a basic NMAP scan to find out which ports the target machine has open.

```bash
nmap 192.168.18.54
```

<h6>Simple NMAP scan</h6>



As we can observe, we find ports 80 and 22 open. Port 80 hosts a webpage, and port 22 runs the SSH service.

We open the website and encounter the following:

<h6>We view this with Ctrl + U</h6>

We obtain a possible username: **paul**.

We enter the file ***bootstrap.min.css*** and find the following information that may be useful to us.

![4](/images/writeups/helium/4.png)

We test the address /yay/mysecretsound.wav, and indeed, it exists. We download the audio.

Upon listening to the audio, you realize it might be in Morse code. So, you go to the [**morsecode.world**](https://morsecode.world/) website to upload the audio and have it decoded.

<h6>Result</h6>

I attempted to log in via SSH with the username **paul** and the password **ETAIE4SIET**, but it didn't work. I noticed a word formed in the audio at the bottom, so I used "dancingpassyd" as the password and successfully logged in.

Now, with the **ls** command, we see that we have the **user flag**.

## Privilege escalation

We use the **sudo -l** command to view the actions we can perform with sudo as root while being the user **paul**. As a result, we see that we can execute the ***/usr/bin/ln*** binary with sudo as if we were root without needing to know their password.

We go to the [**GTFOBins**](https://gtfobins.github.io/) website and look for information on how to escalate privileges using the **sudo ln** command.

<h6>Search result on GTFOBins</h6>

We copy the commands and execute them:

```bash
sudo ln -fs /bin/sh /bin/ln
```

```bash
sudo ln
```

We have successfully become the root and we can obtain their **flag**.

```bash
cat /root/root.txt
```
